# High-level Page Intent -> Page Blueprint

Use this file to turn a business-language page request into the simplified public page blueprint used by `applyBlueprint`.

Start with [whole-page-quick.md](./whole-page-quick.md) when the route is still being chosen or the request looks common-case. Come here once whole-page routing is already confirmed and you need the full authoring flow, the page shape is mixed or uncommon, or the task has reached the real authoring / write-preparation stage.

Do not use this as the first stop for a standard single-tab management, detail, or dashboard draft.

This file is for the inner page document only. For the actual nb raw body, pair it with [tool-shapes.md](./tool-shapes.md). For navigation layout/group/page identity, use [navigation-targets.md](./navigation-targets.md). For template choices, keep [templates.md](./templates.md) as the planning source of truth.

## Goal

Turn business intent into:

1. one executable draft page blueprint document
2. one `nb api flow-surfaces apply-blueprint` call with that raw business blueprint

## Route

Use this file only when the task is whole-page authoring. If the request is really a small change on an existing page, switch to [runtime-playbook.md](./runtime-playbook.md) instead.

## Authoring Flow

1. Identify whether the request is `create` or `replace`.
2. If one request spans several pages, split it into ordered single-page runs first.
3. Start from the smallest useful pattern in [page-archetypes.md](./page-archetypes.md).
4. Default a normal single-page request to exactly one tab unless the user explicitly asked for multiple route-backed tabs.
5. Remove placeholder tabs and placeholder `markdown` / note / banner blocks unless the user explicitly asked for them.
6. Decide major blocks first, then fields and actions.
7. If the draft contains a repeat-eligible popup / block / fields scene, or one strong standard reusable scene, and you are actually deciding whether to bind / reuse / standardize a template-backed scene, probe [templates.md](./templates.md) before locking in that reusable path.
8. Contextual `list-templates` is mandatory for those reusable scenes; keyword-only search stays discovery-only. Fresh one-off pages with explicit local popup / block content, no existing template reference, and no reuse / save-template ask should stay inline and skip template routing.
9. When no explicit `popup.template` is present, keep `popup.tryTemplate=true` as the execution fallback. Local popup content may remain as the fallback when present.
10. If the user explicitly wants the new local popup itself to become reusable immediately, or the first repeated popup seed already exists as local popup content and probing found no usable template, prefer `popup.saveAsTemplate={ name, description }`. It cannot be combined with `popup.template`; it may coexist with `popup.tryTemplate=true`, where a hit reuses the matched template directly and a miss needs explicit local `popup.blocks` so the fallback popup can be saved.
11. Assemble the final blueprint using [page-blueprint.md](./page-blueprint.md).
12. Before invoking the backend write, confirm the draft can satisfy backend authoring validation:
    - in `create`, every newly created `navigation.group` / `navigation.item` carries one semantic Ant Design icon
    - tabs count matches the request
    - every `tab.blocks` is non-empty
    - no block contains `layout`
    - if one tab or popup contains multiple non-filter blocks, it has explicit `layout` and each non-template-backed data block has a `title`; template-backed blocks are exempt; a single non-filter block may omit its `title` unless the user explicitly asks for one
    - block `key` values are unique
    - any explicit `layout` references only real keyed blocks and places every keyed block exactly once
    - every chosen field has a non-empty live `interface`
    - ambiguous `筛选` defaults to a block-level `filter` action, not a `filterForm`
    - any `filterForm` with 4 or more fields includes `collapse`
    - every custom `edit` popup contains exactly one `editForm`
    - data-bound blocks are planned against live collection metadata; backend performs final metadata-based normalization and hard validation
    - with resolved `collectionMetadata`, every involved scope has the required `defaults.collections` entry, required popup `{ name, description }` values for the fixed `view` / `addNew` / `edit` trio, and required large-popup `fieldGroups` only when a fixed generated scene still exceeds the threshold; `table` blocks always enter the `addNew` check
13. Then open [tool-shapes.md](./tool-shapes.md) and invoke `nb api flow-surfaces apply-blueprint` with the draft raw business payload. Do not wrap the payload in helper envelopes such as `{ blueprint }`, `{ values }`, or `cliBody`.

## Heuristics

- Prefer the minimum number of tabs that explains the page.
- Side-by-side blocks, relation tables, and deep popups normally stay inside one tab, not in separate route-backed tabs.
- Users may describe blocks, relations, and actions in business language only. Infer the minimum executable structure instead of expanding into a rigid pseudo-spec.
- Prefer `navigation.group.routeId` when the non-mobile destination group is already known.
- Navigation decisions follow [navigation-targets.md](./navigation-targets.md): a selected no-code Portal always uses its resolved `navigation.portalUid` and omits `navigation.layoutUid`; a mobile-backed no-code Portal also omits `navigation.group`. Only explicit `capabilities.multiPortal === false` legacy mobile intent sets `navigation.layoutUid: "mobile-layout-model"`. Duplicate same-title non-mobile groups require explicit `routeId`; same target layout/Portal + same group/root + same page title may replace, but a different group or target layout/Portal must not merge, reuse, or auto-replace.
- If the user says clicking a shown record or relation record opens details, prefer a field popup rather than inventing a button.
- Keep `fields[]` as simple strings unless a field object is actually needed.
- Omit `layout` only when the tab/popup contains at most one non-filter block. Otherwise decide the layout explicitly instead of relying on default vertical stacking.
- Keep low-level selectors such as `uid`, `ref`, or `$ref` out of the blueprint.

## Reaction Intent

- if the structure is being built now, keep reaction logic in blueprint `reaction.items[]`
- if the page already exists, do `getReactionMeta` first and write through the matching `set*Rules`

Keep detailed reaction payload shapes in [reaction.md](./reaction.md).
