# Execution Checklist

Canonical write path is `nb api flow-surfaces <action>`. When runtime/auth is missing, report the blocked nb command before writing.

Use this checklist after the matching quick route is already clear. For global rules, see [normative-contract.md](./normative-contract.md). For navigation layout/group/page identity, use [navigation-targets.md](./navigation-targets.md). For template planning and existing template reference edits, keep [templates.md](./templates.md) as the only source of truth.

## 1. Preflight

- Confirm the task is really about Modern page (v2) UI.
- Before every other UI Builder preflight step, load and execute `nocobase-portal-manage` for the same request unless a current-request Portal Manager routing outcome is already present. Reuse that outcome instead of recursively invoking Portal Manager after its no-code dispatch.
- Complete [navigation-targets.md](./navigation-targets.md) Portal preflight: one selected Portal is not enough; require its inventory record to report `portalType === "no-code"`, explicit `capabilities.multiPortal === false` legacy evidence, or Portal Manager's verified legacy Flow Surfaces signature. A sole AI Portal exits UI Builder without writing but immediately continues the same request through its source project; do not ask whether to use it or create a no-code Portal. Missing or unsupported types return to Portal Manage for resolution.
- Confirm `nb` is available, then run:
  - `nb --help`
- If runtime/auth is missing, report the blocked nb command before writing.
- Before first use of a specific action, run `nb api flow-surfaces <action> --help` when available.
- Decide the route early:
  - whole-page create / replace
  - localized existing-surface edit
  - reaction authoring
- If one user request spans several pages, split it into ordered single-page runs first.
- Determine the target before the first whole-page draft. A confirmed no-code Portal uses its resolved `navigation.portalUid`. Only the proven legacy lane defaults to desktop/admin `admin-layout-model`; legacy mobile intent uses `navigation.layoutUid: "mobile-layout-model"`, `navigation.item`, and no `navigation.group`.
- Follow [navigation-targets.md](./navigation-targets.md) for duplicate same-title group handling, multi-page shared-group serialization, and duplicate page identity.
- If real fields or relations matter, gather live schema first with `nb api data-modeling collections get --filter-by-tk <collection> --appends fields -j`. If that command family is unavailable, use `nb api resource list --resource collections --filter '{"name":"<collection>"}' --appends fields -j`. Drop any field whose `interface` is empty / null before authoring.
- If JS is involved, validate it first and route through [js.md](./js.md).
- If a dashboard asks for chart / 图表 / Charts / trend / 趋势 / distribution / 分布 / ranking / 排行 / percentage / 占比, record the required chart sections before drafting; KPI JSBlocks and tables/lists cannot satisfy those chart sections.
- Before any write or body-based read, confirm the transport shape:
  - `get` uses top-level locator flags and no JSON body
  - body-based `flow-surfaces` commands take the raw business object through `--body` / `--body-file`
  - never wrap that same object again before passing it to `nb api flow-surfaces`
- Never invent `"root"` for `target.uid` or `locator.uid`.

## 2. Template Decision Gate

- Enter the template path only after the structural route is clear.
- For repeat-eligible popup / block / fields scenes, and for one standard reusable scene with strong context, contextual `list-templates` is mandatory before binding a template or finalizing a reusable/template-backed fallback.
- Fresh whole-page `create` work with explicit local popup / block content, no existing template reference, and no reuse / save-template ask should stay inline and skip template routing.
- Keyword-only search stays discovery-only; it is not enough to prove a binding choice.
- When no explicit `popup.template` is present, treat `popup.tryTemplate=true` as the write fallback, not as the planning truth source.
- If there is no explicit local popup content, let the backend miss path continue; if there is local popup content, keep that content as the fallback.
- When the user explicitly wants the new local popup itself to become reusable immediately, or the first repeated popup seed already exists as local popup content and contextual probing found no usable template, use `popup.saveAsTemplate={ name, description }`.
- `popup.saveAsTemplate` cannot be combined with `popup.template`; it may coexist with `popup.tryTemplate=true`, where a hit reuses the matched template directly and a miss needs explicit local `popup.blocks` so the fallback popup can be saved.
- If a localized edit already hits an existing template reference, route through [templates.md](./templates.md) before writing.
- Existing template reference edits default to the template-source route for template-owned content. Keep host-local config changes local, and treat page-scoped wording as not local-only intent.
- If existing-reference scope is still unresolved, stop and clarify instead of auto-detaching or using `copy` as a safety fallback.

## 3. Whole-page Create / Replace

Use this path when the user is describing one entire page.

1. Start with [whole-page-quick.md](./whole-page-quick.md). Once whole-page routing is confirmed, read [page-intent.md](./page-intent.md) and [page-blueprint.md](./page-blueprint.md). Open [tool-shapes.md](./tool-shapes.md) only when preparing the real nb body.
2. Draft one entire page blueprint only. `applyBlueprint` is for one entire page, not a tiny patch. Whole-page includes whole-page create / replace, one route-backed tab full build, complex multi-block pages, nested-popup pages, and pages with multiple reaction families.
3. Default a normal single-page request to exactly one tab. Do not add placeholder tabs or placeholder `markdown` / note / banner blocks.
4. Keep `fields[]` as simple strings unless `popup`, `target`, `renderer`, field-specific `type`, or clear form behavior inferred from live field `description` is actually required.
5. Keep `layout` only on `tabs[]` or inline `popup`. Omit it only when that tab/popup has at most one non-filter block; otherwise explicit layout is required before write.
6. Before the first write, confirm the draft can satisfy backend authoring validation:
   - in `create`, every newly created `navigation.group` / `navigation.item` carries a semantic Ant Design icon
   - tabs count matches the request
   - every `tab.blocks` is non-empty
   - no block contains `layout`
   - block `key` values are unique
   - any explicit `layout` references only real keyed blocks, places every keyed block exactly once, and does not duplicate one block across multiple cells
   - if one tab or popup contains multiple non-filter blocks, it has explicit `layout` and each non-template-backed data block has a `title`; template-backed blocks are exempt; a single non-filter block may omit its `title` unless the user explicitly asks for one
   - every chosen field has a non-empty live `interface`
   - any requested `table` / `list` / `gridCard` / `calendar` / `kanban` filtering/search action lands on the intended host instead of silently turning into `filterForm`
   - any requested dashboard chart section has a matching `type: "chart"` block, and explicit chart counts are met before write
   - any `filterForm` with 4 or more fields includes `collapse`
   - every custom `edit` popup contains exactly one `editForm`
      - data-bound blocks are planned against current live metadata
   - backend validates the involved `defaults.collections` entries, popup `{ name, description }` values for the fixed `view` / `addNew` / `edit` trio, and large-popup `fieldGroups` when any fixed scene stays above the threshold; `table` blocks always pull their collection into the `addNew` check
7. Pre-write reads and metadata fetch are allowed, but the first mutating write in this route must be `applyBlueprint` through `nb api flow-surfaces apply-blueprint`.
8. Before one whole-page `applyBlueprint` succeeds, do not issue `createMenu`, `createPage`, `compose`, `configure`, `update-settings`, `add*`, `move*`, `remove*`, or `set*Rules`.
9. In execution, invoke `nb api flow-surfaces apply-blueprint` once with the raw business payload.
10. If you persist the payload to a file for the final nb write, persist the raw backend payload itself.
11. If a whole-page `applyBlueprint` fails before first success, repair the blueprint from backend aggregate `errors[]` and retry blueprint-only up to 5 rounds. Do not continue with low-level writes during those pre-success retries. After 5 failed rounds, report the latest payload / error evidence.
12. Do not wrap that business object again.
13. A successful `apply-blueprint` response is the default stop point. Run follow-up `get` only when follow-up localized work or explicit inspection needs live structure. Chart-required dashboards are an explicit inspection case: read back the returned `pageSchemaUid` and confirm chart block evidence before claiming completion. After a successful `applyBlueprint`, localized low-level repair may address only an explicit local/live gap and should stay narrowly scoped. When follow-up work needs live structure, use the returned `target` / `pageSchemaUid` for `nb api flow-surfaces get` and targeted readback from [verification.md](./verification.md).

## 4. Localized Existing-surface Edit

Use this path when the user wants to change only part of an existing surface.

1. Start with [local-edit-quick.md](./local-edit-quick.md). Once localized-edit routing is confirmed, read [runtime-playbook.md](./runtime-playbook.md). Open [tool-shapes.md](./tool-shapes.md) only when the write shape is actually needed.
2. Use `get` to locate the target. Use `describe-surface` only when the richer tree helps.
3. Use `catalog` only when capability uncertainty is the real blocker.
4. Keep the write as small as possible:
   - `compose` for structured insertion
   - `configure` / `update-settings` for semantic settings changes
   - `add-*`, `move-*`, `remove-*`, `update-*` for node lifecycle
5. If the localized change is really reaction work, do not guess raw configure keys. Start with `get-reaction-meta`.
6. Read back only the affected target or parent after the write.

## 5. Reaction Work

- Start with [reaction-quick.md](./reaction-quick.md) when the task is reaction-first. Use this section only after that route is already confirmed.
- Whole-page reaction work belongs in blueprint `reaction.items[]`.
- Localized reaction work starts with `get-reaction-meta` and then writes through the matching `set-field-value-rules`, `set-field-linkage-rules`, `set-block-linkage-rules`, or `set-action-linkage-rules`.
- Keep form field-value and form field-linkage writes targeted at the outer form block uid/path, not the inner grid.
- Use [reaction.md](./reaction.md) for payload details and [templates.md](./templates.md) if the target already carries a template reference.

## 6. Schema / Capability Reads

- Use `nb api data-modeling collections list -j` only to narrow candidates.
- Use `nb api data-modeling collections get --filter-by-tk <collection> --appends fields -j` as the authoring truth. If that command family is unavailable, use `nb api resource list --resource collections --filter '{"name":"<collection>"}' --appends fields -j`.
- Do not use `nb api data-modeling collections fields list` / `data-modeling fields list` for page authoring / field discovery.
- Use `nb api data-modeling collections fields list --collection-name <collection> --filter '{"name":"<field>"}' -j` only for known single-field follow-up.
- If required schema is missing, stop and hand off to `nocobase-data-modeling`.

## 7. Stop / Handoff

Stop instead of guessing when:

- `nb` is unavailable or cannot expose the required command family
- the target is still ambiguous after readback
- the task is really ACL, workflow, data-modeling, browser validation, or non-Modern-page navigation
- the request is about editing template-owned content under an existing template reference but still does not clearly resolve to edit-template-source, edit-host-local-config, switch-template-reference, or detach-to-copy

## 8. Final Evidence

- For chart-required dashboards, the final summary must list `chart blocks: <title> -> <asset key or live chart uid>`.
- If readback only proves `jsBlock`, `table`, or `list` content for a requested chart section, say the chart section is unfinished instead of claiming dashboard completion.
