# Whole-page Quick Route

Use this file as the default first stop for whole-page `create` / `replace` work.

Stay on this route when the user is asking for a full page or one route-backed tab, not a small patch on an existing live surface.

Treat these as whole-page too: a whole page create / replace, one route-backed tab full build, a complex multi-block page, a nested-popup page, or a page with multiple reaction families.

## Common-case flow

1. Pick the simplest page shape directly:
   - management page with explicit filter/search block/form intent -> read [blocks/filter-form.md](./blocks/filter-form.md) and keep a real `filterForm` in the same blueprint
   - tree filter / 树筛选 / 树状筛选 -> read [blocks/tree.md](./blocks/tree.md) and keep a real `tree` block bound to the target collection
   - management page with ambiguous filter wording, or with wording that explicitly adds search to table/list/grid/card-like content -> keep the data block and materialize a block-level `filter` action
   - management page without filtering -> table, list, details, or another primary data block
   - detail page -> details block, maybe one related table
   - analytics dashboard / 分析看板 -> summary, charts, light actions
   - kanban / pipeline / 状态列 / 拖拽 / 泳道 / backlog -> kanban
   - portal / static page -> markdown, iframe, `jsBlock`, or `actionPanel`

Dashboard self-check before first write:

- numeric metrics / KPI cards -> `jsBlock`
- trends / distributions / rankings / percentages / 占比 -> `chart`
- latest records / top-N records -> `table` or `list`
- `actionPanel` only when the user asked for operations or shortcuts
- if a KPI area is implemented with `actionPanel`, regenerate before `applyBlueprint`
- if the request mentions 图表 / Charts / trend / 趋势 / distribution / 分布 / ranking / 排行 / percentage / 占比, open [blocks/chart.md](./blocks/chart.md) and keep a real chart block for each requested chart section
- `jsBlock` and `table` / `list` summaries do not satisfy chart coverage; if a required chart section is missing or downgraded, regenerate before `applyBlueprint`
- whole-page chart blocks use canonical `assets.charts + block.chart`, not inline `settings.query` / `settings.visual`

Do not treat "can render something" as sufficient for dashboard metric sections. Block choice must match the section semantics.

2. Default a normal request to exactly one real tab.
3. Determine the navigation target through Required Portal Preflight before drafting navigation; use [navigation-targets.md](./navigation-targets.md) for the full Portal/layout/group/page-identity matrix. A selected no-code Portal always runs `list-navigation-targets`, maps the selected Portal exactly, and sets its `navigation.portalUid`, even when the user did not mention a workspace; omit `navigation.layoutUid`. Direct desktop/admin targeting and mobile `navigation.layoutUid: "mobile-layout-model"` are allowed only in the legacy lane proven by `capabilities.multiPortal === false`. Never send `portalUid` and `layoutUid` together.
4. Collect live collection metadata before choosing fields. Any field used in the blueprint should come from live metadata and should have a non-empty `interface`.
  - You do not need to hand-build a helper envelope; backend authoring validation uses live metadata and returns aggregate errors for hard failures.
   - On every whole-page draft, recompute the involved target collections from that live metadata and rebuild `defaults.collections` from scratch instead of patching an old fragment.
   - Under `defaults.collections`, every involved direct collection always carries fixed `popups.view` / `addNew` / `edit` `{ name, description }` objects, and any `table` block always pulls its collection into the `addNew` threshold evaluation even when the draft omitted an explicit `addNew` opener.
   - For whole-page popup defaults, generate top-level `defaults.collections.<collection>.fieldGroups` only when one of those fixed backend-generated popup scenes should still have more than 10 effective fields after scene filtering; for 10 or fewer, omit `fieldGroups`.
   - When any backend-generated add/edit candidate field for that collection has a non-empty `description`, account for each described generated field with either structured `defaults.collections.<collection>.formBehavior.addNew/edit` output or sibling `defaults.collections.<collection>.formBehaviorDescriptionReview.fields.<field> = { decision, reasonCode? }`. Use `implemented` only with real structured coverage; use `noUiBehavior` / `unsupported` with a valid `reasonCode` for reviewed non-implemented descriptions. Do not use old `fields[]`, `hasTried`, `formBehavior: {}`, or `null` as no-op escapes; `null` review entries are only for empty descriptions.
   - After generating defaults fieldGroups, run one fast self-review with a short structured verdict (`approve` or `regenerate`) covering semantic grouping, required-field coverage, group balance, and group title specificity. Use the lowest practical reasoning effort / no-think mode, do not request chain-of-thought, and if the verdict is `regenerate`, rebuild those groups once from live metadata and stop after that single retry.
   - Keep `fieldGroups` collection-only on the target collection; do not create per-association `fieldGroups`. Keep relation-field popup descriptors under `popups.associations.<associationField>.<action>` with the same fixed `view` / `addNew` / `edit` `{ name, description }` contract, keyed only by the first relation segment.
   - Keep defaults collection-level only: do not generate `defaults.blocks`, and do not put `blocks`, `fields`, `fieldGroups`, or layout inside `popups`.
5. For fresh page creation under a menu group, default to one whole-page `applyBlueprint` `create` write. Pre-write reads and metadata fetch are allowed, but the first mutating write must be backend `applyBlueprint`.
   - Before one whole-page `applyBlueprint` succeeds, do not call `createMenu`, `createPage`, `compose`, `configure`, `update-settings`, `add*`, `move*`, `remove*`, or `set*Rules`.
   - If a whole-page `applyBlueprint` fails before first success, repair the blueprint from backend aggregate `errors[]` and retry blueprint-only up to 5 rounds. Do not continue with low-level writes during those pre-success retries. After 5 failed rounds, report the latest blueprint / error evidence.
   - Agent orchestration rule: if one request spans multiple non-mobile pages that share the same menu group title in the same target layout, serialize the page runs and carry the first page's resolved `routeId`; concurrent title-only shared-group creates are forbidden. Mobile page runs do not use shared menu groups.
   - If the user asks for an AI employee, AI assistant, AI analysis button, or AI helper task, include `type: "aiEmployee"` actions in this first `applyBlueprint` wherever the catalog permits them: table/list/grid/card block `actions`, record-capable `recordActions`, form `actions`, or inline popup form actions. Read [ai-employee-actions.md](./ai-employee-actions.md) and use public `settings`; do not create the page first and patch raw AI `props`.
   - If the page asks for comments or record history, use public block types `comments` and `recordHistory` in the first `applyBlueprint`; read [blocks/comments.md](./blocks/comments.md) or [blocks/record-history.md](./blocks/record-history.md). Do not author raw model names or internal `stepParams`.
6. For non-mobile `create`, any newly created `navigation.group` and any top-level or second-level `navigation.item` must include one valid semantic Ant Design icon. For mobile creates, `navigation.item.icon` is the page entry icon and no group icon is needed.
7. If visible duplicate same-title menu groups already exist in the target layout for a non-mobile page, require explicit `navigation.group.routeId` before the write; do not pick one locally or create another same-title group. For mobile pages, omit `navigation.group`.
8. Page identity follows [navigation-targets.md](./navigation-targets.md): same target layout/Portal + same group/root + same `page.title` may replace; a different group or different target layout/Portal with the same title is distinct and must not merge, reuse, or auto-replace.
9. When the page is being created now, keep structure, popup, and whole-page interaction logic in the same blueprint:
   - root blocks in `tabs[].blocks[]`
   - popup content inline under the owning field/action/record action
   - interaction logic in top-level `reaction.items[]`
   - in display hosts (`table`, `details`, `list`, `gridCard`), first-level relation fields such as `roles` must use object form with inline `popup`; do not leave them as ``"roles"`` or `{ "field": "roles" }`
   - that relation field popup must also bind its child blocks correctly: `details` / `editForm` use `resource.binding = "currentRecord"` for the clicked related record, while relation tables/lists/cards use `resource.binding = "associatedRecords"` plus `resource.associationField`
   - dotted paths such as `department.title` stay allowed without popup, and `createForm` / `editForm` are exempt from that display-only rule
9. If the page explicitly asks for a tree filter (`树筛选 / 树状筛选 / tree filter`), keep a real `tree` block in that first-pass blueprint or localized write:
   - use `type: "tree"` / `TreeBlockModel`
   - bind it to the requested collection with live metadata
   - when connecting the tree to a same-blueprint table/list/gridCard/calendar/kanban/details/chart/map/comments/tree target, prefer Blueprint-stage `settings.connectFields.targets[].target` with the target block key
   - same collection may omit `filterPaths`; cross-collection tree connects must provide `filterPaths`, for example `["department.id"]`
   - do not repeat the same target in one tree `targets` array; keep one entry with the final `filterPaths`
   - `titleField` is display-only; the selected filter value comes from the tree key / `filterTargetKey`, so keep target `filterPaths` type-compatible with that key
   - prefer `title`, `searchable`, `includeDescendants`, `defaultExpandAll`, `titleField`, `fieldNames`, `pageSize`, `dataScope`, and `sorting` settings
   - use canonical `settings.sorting`; legacy `settings.sort` is only a compatibility alias that backend authoring normalizes
   - do not write raw `filterManager`; let `settings.connectFields` persist the front-end “连接数据区块” configuration
   - do not downgrade it into `filterForm` just because the phrase also contains `筛选`
10. If the page explicitly asks for a filter block/form, keep a real `filterForm` in that first-pass blueprint:
   - add non-empty filter `fields`
   - when the filter has fewer than 4 fields, add `actions: ["submit", "reset"]`
   - when the filter has 4 or more fields, add `actions: ["submit", "reset", "collapse"]`
   - point each filter field `target` at a same-blueprint table key as a plain string block key
   - if the page has one filter for `users` and one for `roles`, keep both `filterForm` blocks in the same first layout row and let each field target only its own same-blueprint table key
   - do not push `defaultTargetUid`, `filterManager`, or block-level `fields` / `actions` into raw `settings`
11. If the page only says “增加筛选 / filter” on an existing or requested table/list/gridCard/calendar/kanban-like surface, or explicitly adds “搜索 / search” to that data surface, including wording such as “支持搜索 / 带搜索 / 可搜索 / searchable”, default to the block action slot instead:
   - use that same host's block-level `filter` action/button; shorthand or object action form is valid
   - direct, non-template public `table` / `list` / `gridCard` / `calendar` / `kanban` blocks may omit `defaultFilter`; backend authoring materializes one from live metadata with up to 4 scalar/filterable fields
   - keep explicit block-level or filter action `defaultFilter` concrete, metadata-valid, and backed by at least the smaller of 3 and the collection's eligible direct interface-field count when overriding generated defaults; explicit empty groups, invalid operators, relation fields used directly, and unknown paths are rejected through backend aggregate `errors[]`
   - for relation filters, write a relation child path such as `department.title`; do not write the relation field itself
   - the `filter` action is optional; if you also provide filter action `settings.defaultFilter`, that action-level payload takes precedence over `defaultActionSettings.filter.defaultFilter` and the block-level one
   - for every direct public data surface, partial `actions` complete to that host's defaults (`filter` / `refresh` / `addNew`, plus table `bulkDelete`); ordinary table partial `recordActions` complete to `view` / `edit` / `delete`, but tree table `recordActions` should be omitted unless explicitly requested so the backend injects only `addChild`
   - do not upgrade that request into `filterForm` unless the user explicitly names a filter/search block, form, or query area
   - do not treat page-noun wording such as “搜索页 / 搜索结果页 / 搜索门户 / 搜索列表页” as a filter request just because the page also mentions list/grid/card presentation, even if the same sentence also says “支持搜索”
   - if the user explicitly names the host, keep the action on that host type instead of silently moving it to another companion block
12. For update action field assignment, use only `settings.assignValues`:
   - `bulkUpdate` is a collection action under block `actions`
   - `updateRecord` is a record action under `recordActions`
   - keys must exist in the host collection metadata, and `{}` clears assignment values
   - do not use `add-fields`, raw `flowModels`, `AssignFormGridModel`, or `AssignFormItemModel` for this configuration
13. If one tab or popup contains multiple non-filter blocks, give it explicit `layout`, avoid one-row-one-block stacking, and give each non-template-backed data block a `title`; template-backed blocks are exempt. A single non-filter block may omit its block `title` unless the user explicitly asks for one, and backend authoring strips redundant persisted title chrome for single-scope non-template data blocks. Filter blocks should sit alone in the first row when they are present.
   - For `createForm`, `editForm`, and `details`, omit block-level `fieldsLayout` unless the draft must control exact placement; backend authoring owns the default two-per-row grid and gives live `richText` / `vditor` fields plus `divider` items full-width rows. `filterForm` may keep compact three-per-row `fieldsLayout`.
   - For `createForm`, `editForm`, or `details`, once the block has more than 10 real fields, replace flat `fields[]` authoring with explicit `fieldGroups`.
   - `fieldGroups` and `fieldsLayout` must not be combined, and manual `divider` entries do not satisfy the large-form grouping rule.
14. Keep popup semantics close to the opener:
   - relation-field click-to-open -> prefer field popup
   - explicit operation button -> prefer action / record-action popup
   - custom edit popup -> keep exactly one `editForm` block in that popup
15. A successful `apply-blueprint` response is the default stop point. Run follow-up `get` only when follow-up localized work or explicit inspection needs live structure. Chart-required dashboards are an explicit inspection case: read back the returned `pageSchemaUid` and confirm chart evidence before claiming completion. When that happens, normalize locators:
   - keep menu placement on `routeId` only
   - use `pageSchemaUid` for `nb api flow-surfaces get`
   - use live `uid` values returned by `get` / `describe-surface` / create responses for `catalog`, `context`, `get-reaction-meta`, `compose`, `configure`, `add*`, and `remove*`
   - never pass a desktop-route `id` as `target.uid`
   - after one successful whole-page `applyBlueprint`, localized low-level repair is allowed only for an explicit local/live gap and should stay narrow
   - if a chart-required dashboard readback has no `chart` block, repair the missing section as `chart` or state unfinished; do not report the dashboard as complete
16. For normal local drafting or artifact-only tasks, stay on this file. Do not enumerate the skill directory or open helper/runtime docs just to reconfirm the route.
17. For artifact-only drafts, do not open [helper-contracts.md](./helper-contracts.md); draft the blueprint/checklist directly from the request. Open it only when investigating optional helper behavior.
18. Open [tool-shapes.md](./tool-shapes.md) only when you are preparing the exact nb body. For the first real whole-page write, send the raw business payload directly to `nb api flow-surfaces apply-blueprint`.
19. For the common nested-popup pattern used by real builds, open [popup.md](./popup.md) directly instead of searching the whole references tree.

## Complex Whole-page Guardrails

These are still whole-page requests, not a separate route.

- Keep one `applyBlueprint` as the default path even when the page has multiple work areas, paired tables, multiple forms, nested popups, or several reaction families.
- Give an explicit `key` to every block, field, or action that will be referenced by:
  - `layout`
  - `filterForm` field `target`
  - top-level `reaction.items[].target`
  - nested popup reaction or readback evidence
- Keep whole-page reaction targets on stable public paths such as:
  - `main.primaryCreateForm`
  - `main.primaryTable.viewAction`
  - `main.secondaryTable.protectedDeleteAction`
- When a form action must be targeted by `reaction.items[]`, do not leave that action as a plain string. Upgrade it to one keyed action object in the first-pass blueprint, for example `{ "key": "submitAction", "type": "submit" }`, then target `main.primaryCreateForm.submitAction`.
- For `filterForm`, keep the field `target` on a same-blueprint string block key. Do not mix public whole-page `target` with low-level `defaultTargetUid`.
- Do not treat "two filter forms targeting two different tables" as a contract gap by itself. Try the direct public whole-page shape first.
- When a `filterForm` has 4 or more fields, include `collapse` in its filter-form action family. Keep the filter block alone in the first layout row when an explicit layout is present.
- When one tab or popup contains multiple non-filter blocks, explicit layout is no longer optional. The layout must reference real keyed blocks and place every keyed block.
- For computed defaults, autofill, block visibility, or action guards that belong to the page being created now, prefer top-level `reaction.items[]` in that same blueprint rather than a second live-edit phase.
- If a create/edit form helper depends on `formValues.*`, prefer a helper host that belongs to that same form scene. If the live scene exposes `fields` / `actions` / `node` but not `blocks`, model the helper as a `jsItem` or other field-like helper rather than a separate sibling block.
- A first-pass miss is not enough to abandon whole-page authoring. Treat it as a blueprint-generation bug or whole-page contract problem to report, not as permission to switch routes mid-phase.
- If a whole-page `applyBlueprint` fails before first success, repair the blueprint from backend aggregate `errors[]` and retry blueprint-only up to 5 rounds instead of dropping into low-level writes before success. After 5 failed rounds, report the latest blueprint / error evidence.
- Only after one successful whole-page `applyBlueprint` may localized `add*` or `set*Rules` repair address an explicit residual local/live gap, and that repair should stay narrowly scoped.

## Default artifact-only output

For artifact-only drafting, write only under:

```text
.artifacts/nocobase-ui-builder/<scenario-id>/
```

Leave exactly:

- `blueprint.json`
- `readback-checklist.md`

For every artifact-only whole-page bundle, `blueprint.json` must be the bare blueprint root with top-level `tabs[]`; do not wrap it under `page`, `draft`, `blueprint`, `scenario`, `metadata`, or any explanatory envelope.

For artifact-only locator boundary handoffs, use `locator-map.json` with direct fields and non-empty placeholder strings:

```json
{ "navigation": { "routeId": "route-id-placeholder" }, "page": { "pageSchemaUid": "page-schema-placeholder" }, "liveTargets": [{ "role": "table", "uid": "live-target-uid-placeholder" }] }
```

Keep `liveTargets[].uid` as a non-empty placeholder when live readback has not happened yet, not `null`; it records the source class and still blocks downstream writes until real readback.

The checklist can stay short. It only needs to confirm create vs replace, the selected no-code Portal's resolved `navigation.portalUid` or an explicitly proven legacy Admin/Mobile target, navigation decisions from [navigation-targets.md](./navigation-targets.md), one real tab by default, non-empty `tabs[]`, and field truth from live `interface` facts when relevant.

## Minimal common-case blueprint

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "mode": "create",
  "defaults": {
      "collections": {
        "support_tickets": {
          "popups": {
            "addNew": { "name": "Create ticket", "description": "Create one support ticket." },
            "view": { "name": "Ticket details", "description": "View one support ticket." },
            "edit": { "name": "Edit ticket", "description": "Edit one support ticket." },
            "associations": {
              "assignee": {
                "view": { "name": "Assignee details", "description": "View one related assignee." },
                "addNew": { "name": "Create assignee", "description": "Create one related assignee." },
                "edit": { "name": "Edit assignee", "description": "Edit one related assignee." }
              }
            }
          }
        }
    }
  },
  "navigation": {
    "portalUid": "<resolved-no-code-portal-uid>",
    "group": { "title": "Workspace", "icon": "AppstoreOutlined" },
    "item": { "title": "Support tickets", "icon": "InboxOutlined" }
  },
  "page": { "title": "Support tickets" },
  "tabs": [
    {
      "key": "main",
      "title": "Overview",
      "blocks": [
        {
          "key": "ticketsTable",
          "type": "table",
          "collection": "support_tickets",
          "defaultFilter": {
            "logic": "$and",
            "items": [
              { "path": "subject", "operator": "$includes", "value": "" },
              { "path": "status", "operator": "$eq", "value": "" },
              { "path": "priority", "operator": "$eq", "value": "" }
            ]
          },
          "fields": ["subject", "status", "priority", "assignee"],
          "actions": ["filter", "addNew"],
          "recordActions": ["view", "edit"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For a mobile-backed selected no-code Portal, keep its resolved `navigation.portalUid` and omit both `navigation.layoutUid` and `navigation.group`. Only a legacy mobile page with explicit `capabilities.multiPortal === false` uses:

```json
"navigation": {
  "layoutUid": "mobile-layout-model",
  "item": { "title": "Support tickets", "icon": "InboxOutlined" }
}
```

Final user-facing links should point at the mobile base route such as `/mobile/<pageSchemaUid>` rather than `/admin/<pageSchemaUid>`.

## Open next only if needed

- [blocks/filter-form.md](./blocks/filter-form.md) if the page explicitly asks for a filter/search block, form, query area, or screening form and you need the real filter-form completion contract
- [ai-employee-actions.md](./ai-employee-actions.md) if the page asks for AI employee / AI assistant placement or task settings
- [blocks/comments.md](./blocks/comments.md) or [blocks/record-history.md](./blocks/record-history.md) if the page asks for comments, discussion threads, history, or audit history
- [popup.md](./popup.md) if the page needs inline popup structure or custom edit/view popup composition
- [whole-page-recipes.md](./whole-page-recipes.md) for reusable whole-page blueprint patterns with paired blocks, nested popups, and top-level reactions
- [page-archetypes.md](./page-archetypes.md) if none of the common page shapes fits cleanly
- [page-blueprint.md](./page-blueprint.md) for the full page grammar, uncommon block shapes, or exact field / action structures
- [helper-contracts.md](./helper-contracts.md) only for optional helper behavior
- [template-quick.md](./template-quick.md) if popup / block / fields reuse, existing template references, or `copy` vs `reference` is actually in scope
- [reaction-quick.md](./reaction-quick.md) if the page needs detailed reaction payload recipes
- [js.md](./js.md) if JS, charts, or `ctx.*` enters the page

For artifact-only drafting, you usually do not need [page-blueprint.md](./page-blueprint.md), [helper-contracts.md](./helper-contracts.md), or [tool-shapes.md](./tool-shapes.md).
For benchmark-style management pages with paired filters / tables / forms, you usually also do not need [page-blueprint.md](./page-blueprint.md) or [tool-shapes.md](./tool-shapes.md) before the first draft. Stay on this file plus [blocks/filter-form.md](./blocks/filter-form.md), [popup.md](./popup.md), and [reaction-quick.md](./reaction-quick.md) unless one concrete shape is still unresolved.

## Switch away when

- the request is really a localized change on an existing live page -> [local-edit-quick.md](./local-edit-quick.md)
- the request is mostly default values / linkage / state rules on an existing page -> [reaction-quick.md](./reaction-quick.md)
