# Filter Condition Format

NocoBase uses a unified filter condition format across all features: block query conditions, data scope settings, ACL permission scopes, workflow node conditions (Query, Update, Delete, Collection Event trigger), and more.

## Mandatory Agent Authoring Gate

This page must be entered through the `nocobase-utils` skill with topic `filter` and read before an Agent creates or edits any persisted or UI-displayable NocoBase filter. Seeing a `filter`, `condition`, `dataScope.filter`, `defaultFilter`, or `{ path, operator, value }` field in another skill is a routing signal to load that skill/topic before choosing an operator. A relative link to this page is an exact location, not a substitute for invoking the skill.

Follow this order every time:

1. Read the target collection's live field metadata.
2. Resolve the terminal field in the path and identify its frontend interface/operator group. For `createdBy.createdAt`, the terminal field is `createdAt`, so it is a date field; for `createdBy.id`, it is an ID field.
3. Find that exact group in [Operators Reference](#operators-reference).
4. Translate the user's intent using only an operator in that row.
5. Before writing, reject the condition if the operator is absent from the row. Do not rely on model knowledge, SQL/JavaScript comparison habits, backend acceptance, or an example from a different field type.

Natural-language comparison words do not determine the operator until the field type is known. In particular, a date field never inherits number operators merely because the user says “less than”, “greater than”, `<`, `>=`, “before”, or “after”.

### Date intent mapping

For a date/datetime terminal field, use this mapping:

| User intent | Required operator |
|---|---|
| on / exactly on a date or named period | `$dateOn` |
| not on a date or named period | `$dateNotOn` |
| before / earlier than / less than / `<` | `$dateBefore` |
| after / later than / greater than / `>` | `$dateAfter` |
| not before / on or after / at least / greater than or equal / `>=` | `$dateNotBefore` |
| not after / on or before / at most / less than or equal / `<=` | `$dateNotAfter` |
| between / within a range | `$dateBetween` |

Therefore “`createdAt` 小于某日期” must become `$dateBefore`, never `$lt`; “`createdAt` 大于等于某日期” must become `$dateNotBefore`, never `$gte`.

This reference covers operator selection across filter representations. Keep the shape required by the host configuration: workflow/server query objects use field/operator objects and their documented logical wrapper, while UI Builder structures such as `{ "logic": "$and", "items": [{ "path": "createdAt", "operator": "$dateBefore", "value": "..." }] }` keep their own shape. Do not convert one representation into another merely because this page was loaded.

## Critical Rules

- **Workflow/server query-object filters MUST use a logical wrapper** — they must have `$and` or `$or` as their only root key. Never put field conditions directly at the root. Structured UI representations such as `{ logic, items }` keep their host-defined shape.
- **Every field condition MUST use an explicit comparison operator object.** Do not use shorthand equality such as `{ "fieldA": 123 }`. Even though the server may accept it, the frontend cannot display it correctly. Use `{ "fieldA": { "$eq": 123 } }` instead.
- **Never invent operator names.** Only use operators from the tables below.
- **Never choose an operator before resolving the field type.** Natural-language words such as “less than” are semantic intent, not permission to emit `$lt`. `$lt` is valid only after metadata proves the terminal field belongs to the number group.
- **Operator allowlists are field-type-specific.** An operator is valid only when it appears in the table for that field type; its presence in another table does not make it reusable. `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` are number-field operators, not general comparison operators. Date comparisons MUST use an operator from the **Date Fields** table. Never use `$eq`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$in`, `$notIn`, or any other non-date comparison operator on a date field, even if the server accepts it, because the frontend cannot display it.
- **For a relation path, use the operator group of the terminal field.** For example, `createdBy.id` uses the ID group, while `createdBy.name` uses the string group. A relation in the path does not make other operator groups available.
- **Operator names are exact strings** with `$` prefix (e.g., `$eq`, `$includes`). Case-sensitive.

## Top-level Structure

```json
{ "$and": [ <condition>, <condition>, ... ] }
{ "$or":  [ <condition>, <condition>, ... ] }
```

Even a single condition must be wrapped:

```json
// ❌ Wrong — field at root level
{ "status": { "$eq": "active" } }

// ✅ Correct — always wrapped
{ "$and": [ { "status": { "$eq": "active" } } ] }
```

`$and` and `$or` can be nested inside each other for complex logic:

```json
{
  "$and": [
    { "status": { "$eq": "active" } },
    {
      "$or": [
        { "type": { "$eq": "vip" } },
        { "level": { "$in": ["gold", "platinum"] } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Condition Structure

Each condition entry is an object with one or more field conditions:

```
{ "<fieldPath>": { "<operator>": <value> } }
```

The value of a field path must always be an operator object. Equality is not a special shorthand; it must be written with `$eq`.

```json
// ❌ Wrong — shorthand equality is not frontend-compatible
{ "fieldA": 123 }

// ✅ Correct — equality uses an explicit operator
{ "fieldA": { "$eq": 123 } }
```

### Direct Fields

```json
{ "status": { "$eq": "active" } }
{ "amount": { "$gte": 100 } }
{ "tags": { "$empty": true } }
```

### Relation Fields

Two equivalent notations are accepted for relation field paths:

**Nested object notation** (recommended for ACL scopes and structured configs):
```json
{ "createdBy": { "id": { "$eq": "{{$user.id}}" } } }
{ "department": { "id": { "$eq": "{{$user.department.id}}" } } }
{ "order": { "status": { "$eq": "paid" } } }
```

**Dot-string notation** (also valid, common in workflow node filter configs):
```json
{ "category.name": { "$eq": "Tech" } }
{ "createdBy.id": { "$eq": "{{$user.id}}" } }
```

Both notations traverse the same association path. Use whichever fits the context; the nested object form is more explicit for deeply nested paths.

## Operators Reference

The standard frontend has no universal comparison operator group. The following matrix mirrors the built-in v1 and v2 frontend operator groups. For each field, use only the operators in its row. A server-supported operator is still forbidden when it is absent from the frontend row because the UI cannot display it.

Custom frontend code can override an interface's operators, but that does not authorize an Agent to use operators outside this reference. Unless an operator is explicitly added to the allowlist here, do not use it in a UI-displayable filter.

| Frontend field/operator group | Common built-in interfaces | Complete allowed operator list |
|---|---|---|
| String | input, textarea, email, phone, URL, password, color, UUID, Nano ID | `$includes`, `$notIncludes`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| Large text | Markdown, rich text | `$includes`, `$notIncludes`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| Number | number, integer, percent, Snowflake ID | `$eq`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| Date/datetime | date only, datetime, datetime without timezone, Unix timestamp, created at, updated at | `$dateOn`, `$dateNotOn`, `$dateBefore`, `$dateAfter`, `$dateNotBefore`, `$dateNotAfter`, `$dateBetween`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| Time | time | `$eq`, `$neq`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| Single select / enum | select, radio group | `$eq`, `$ne`, `$in`, `$notIn`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| Array / multi-select | multiple select, checkbox group | `$match`, `$notMatch`, `$anyOf`, `$noneOf`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| Boolean | checkbox | `$isTruly`, `$isFalsy`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| ID / relation existence | ID, the terminal ID field of a relation path | `$eq`, `$ne`, `$exists`, `$notExists` |
| Object | fields explicitly assigned the object operator group | `$eq`, `$ne` |
| Collection | collection selector | `$eq`, `$ne`, `$in`, `$notIn`, `$empty`, `$notEmpty` |
| Table OID | table OID | `$childIn`, `$childNotIn` |

### String and Large-text Fields

| Operator | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
| `$includes` | Contains substring | `"keyword"` |
| `$notIncludes` | Does not contain substring | `"keyword"` |
| `$eq` | Equals one scalar value | `"active"` |
| `$ne` | Does not equal one scalar value | `"draft"` |
| `$empty` | Is null or an empty string | *(no value needed)* |
| `$notEmpty` | Is neither null nor an empty string | *(no value needed)* |

> `$startsWith`, `$notStartsWith`, `$endWith`, and `$notEndWith` are supported by the database but are not registered in the standard frontend operator groups. Do not use them in UI-displayable filters.

### Number Fields

These eight operators are the complete standard frontend allowlist for number fields. `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` are not general-purpose comparison operators and MUST NOT be used for dates, strings, or any other field type.

| Operator | Applies to | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$eq` | number only | Equal | `100` |
| `$ne` | number only | Not equal | `100` |
| `$gt` | number only | Greater than | `100` |
| `$gte` | number only | Greater than or equal | `100` |
| `$lt` | number only | Less than | `100` |
| `$lte` | number only | Less than or equal | `100` |
| `$empty` | number only | Is null | *(no value needed)* |
| `$notEmpty` | number only | Is not null | *(no value needed)* |

### Single-select / Enum and Collection Fields

| Operator | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
| `$eq` | Equals one option | `"active"` |
| `$ne` | Does not equal one option | `"draft"` |
| `$in` | Is any of the options | `["a", "b"]` |
| `$notIn` | Is none of the options | `["x", "y"]` |
| `$empty` | Is empty | *(no value needed)* |
| `$notEmpty` | Is not empty | *(no value needed)* |

> `$in` and `$notIn` are not general scalar operators. In the standard frontend they belong to the single-select/enum and collection groups. Multi-select and array fields use `$anyOf` and `$noneOf` instead.

### Array / Multi-select Fields

| Operator | Applies to | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$match` | array | Array exactly matches the given set (all elements, no extras) | `["a", "b"]` |
| `$notMatch` | array | Array does not exactly match | `["a", "b"]` |
| `$anyOf` | array | Array contains at least one of the given values | `["a", "b"]` |
| `$noneOf` | array | Array contains none of the given values. Null-safe. | `["a", "b"]` |
| `$empty` | array | Array is empty or null | *(no value needed)* |
| `$notEmpty` | array | Array is not empty | *(no value needed)* |

> `$arrayEmpty` and `$arrayNotEmpty` are database operators, not standard frontend operators. Use `$empty` and `$notEmpty` so the condition remains displayable.

### Boolean Fields

| Operator | Applies to | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$isTruly` | boolean | Is truthy (`true`). Pass `true` to test for true; pass `false` to invert. | `true` |
| `$isFalsy` | boolean | Is falsy (`false` or null). Pass `true` to test for falsy; pass `false` to invert. | `true` |
| `$empty` | boolean | Is null | *(no value needed)* |
| `$notEmpty` | boolean | Is not null | *(no value needed)* |

### Date Fields

Date fields use only the comparison operators listed below. These operators accept either an ISO date string or a named shortcut string (e.g., `"today"`, `"thisWeek"`, `"lastMonth"`).

> **Strict allowlist:** For a date or datetime comparison, choose one of the seven date comparison operators in this table. Do not create or reuse any comparison operator not listed here. Semantically similar generic operators such as `$lt` and `$gte` are forbidden because the filter UI cannot display them. Use `$dateBefore` and `$dateNotBefore`, respectively.

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|
| `$dateOn` | Date falls on the given date/period |
| `$dateNotOn` | Date does not fall on the given date/period |
| `$dateBefore` | Date is before the given date/period |
| `$dateNotBefore` | Date is not before (≥) the given date/period |
| `$dateAfter` | Date is after the given date/period |
| `$dateNotAfter` | Date is not after (≤) the given date/period |
| `$dateBetween` | Date falls within the given range (array of two date values) |
| `$empty` | Date is null |
| `$notEmpty` | Date is not null |

```json
// ❌ Wrong — generic comparison operators are not displayable for date fields
{ "$and": [ { "createdAt": { "$lt": "2024-12-31" } } ] }
{ "$and": [ { "createdAt": { "$gte": "2024-01-01" } } ] }

// ✅ Correct — use only operators from the Date Fields table
{ "$and": [ { "createdAt": { "$dateBefore": "2024-12-31" } } ] }
{ "$and": [ { "createdAt": { "$dateNotBefore": "2024-01-01" } } ] }
```

### Time Fields

| Operator | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
| `$eq` | Equal | `"09:30:00"` |
| `$neq` | Not equal | `"09:30:00"` |
| `$empty` | Is null | *(no value needed)* |
| `$notEmpty` | Is not null | *(no value needed)* |

> The frontend time operator is exactly `$neq`. Do not replace it with `$ne` when authoring a UI-displayable time condition.

### ID / Relation-existence Fields

| Operator | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
| `$eq` | ID equals one value | `1` |
| `$ne` | ID does not equal one value | `1` |
| `$exists` | The relation represented by the terminal ID exists | *(no value needed)* |
| `$notExists` | The relation represented by the terminal ID does not exist | *(no value needed)* |

The ID group does not expose `$in`, `$notIn`, `$empty`, or `$notEmpty` in the standard frontend.

### Object Fields

The object operator group exposes only `$eq` and `$ne`. Do not use string, number, membership, or empty operators unless the field interface explicitly overrides its frontend operator list.

### Table OID Fields

| Operator | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
| `$childIn` | Is any of the child collections | `["collectionA", "collectionB"]` |
| `$childNotIn` | Is none of the child collections | `["collectionA", "collectionB"]` |

## Variable Values

Condition values can be dynamic variables using `{{path}}` double-brace syntax (powered by [json-templates](https://github.com/nicktindall/json-templates)). The variable is resolved at runtime before the filter is applied.

```json
{ "$and": [ { "createdBy": { "id": { "$eq": "{{$user.id}}" } } } ] }
{ "$and": [ { "department": { "id": { "$eq": "{{$user.department.id}}" } } } ] }
```

Available variable paths depend on the context:

| Context | Common variables |
|---|---|
| ACL scope | `{{$user.id}}`, `{{$user.<field>}}`, `{{$user.<relation>.<field>}}`, `{{$nRole}}` |
| Workflow node condition | `{{$context.data.<field>}}`, `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.<key>.<field>}}` |
| Block / UI linkage | Depends on the block's data context |
