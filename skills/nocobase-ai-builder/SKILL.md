# Goal

Turn a user's business request into a coherent, production-shaped AI Portal application (`/x/<name>`) or Code-First frontend. Own both product design and source implementation: do not stop at a mechanical CRUD example when the user has not supplied detailed information architecture, page composition, copy, or visual direction.

> **Multi-Version Architectural Matrix**:
> - **In NocoBase 2.4-alpha**: AI Portals run under `/x/<name>`, scaffolded from `@nocobase/portal-template-default` with `@nocobase/portal-sdk`, managed via `nb portal dev` and `nb portal deploy`.
> - **In NocoBase 3.0-alpha**: Acts as the primary UI building mode ("Vibe Coding"). Frontend is decoupled from server JSON schema blocks, utilizing Modern React + Refine + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui connected directly to NocoBase collections via REST APIs or `@nocobase/sdk`.

# Entry Contract

- Use this skill for every development request after a Portal record has been resolved with `portalType === "ai"`.
- Consume the resolved Portal name, environment, and local source path from `nocobase-portal-manage` when available. Do not resolve a different Portal inside this skill.
- Do not begin source edits without a real local source directory. If the selected AI Portal's `developmentPath` / `localPath` / local source path is empty in `nb portal list -j` or `nb portal info <portal> -j`, run `nb portal pull <portal>` first through the Portal workflow, read the Portal info/list again, then enter the pulled development directory before applying this skill.
- Reject source storage configuration as a working directory. `sourceStorage`, `git_repo`, `git_branch`, `git_path`, `--git-path`, repository subdirectories, and deployment/storage paths identify where Portal source is stored for pull/push/deploy; they are not the local development directory for source edits unless `nb portal pull` readback explicitly returns the same path as `developmentPath` / `localPath`.
- When the user is already working in a recognizable AI Portal source project, use that project directly unless the request identifies another Portal.
- Treat `@nocobase/portal-template-default` as the canonical base-template package. Unless the user explicitly narrows the request, upgrading a Portal means safely applying the latest base-template source changes to the user project, together with required `@nocobase/portal-sdk` and installed Registry migrations; it never means only changing package or compatibility versions.
- Treat the original build request as authorization to edit and verify that Portal source. Do not ask for a second code-edit confirmation.
- Read the project's `AGENTS.md` and applicable local instructions before changing files.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes. Do not push or deploy unless the user requests it.

# Required Workflow

## 1. Inspect the current application

Use question-driven, progressive discovery before designing or writing code. Do not build a complete inventory of the repository as a routine prerequisite.

Scope discovery to the current task or milestone. Inspect application source only when it answers a concrete question or supports the current change, and defer unrelated layers until they become relevant.

1. Read the project instructions, package scripts, and the route or feature entry points directly relevant to the request.
2. Search by filename, symbol, route, export, or import before opening files. Inspect the closest matching implementation and only the direct dependencies needed to understand its public contract.
3. Identify the relevant branding, navigation, theme, authentication, ACL, i18n, API, and asset conventions from those files. Expand the search only when a specific unanswered question blocks a safe implementation.
4. Confirm collections, fields, associations, and actions from real NocoBase metadata, Swagger documents, responses, or existing code. When API integration is in scope, use `nb api swagger list/get` to read the narrowest relevant document namespace. Never invent backend contracts.
5. For a new or substantially redesigned system, identify the template demo surface that must be replaced without auditing unrelated Registry items or application features.

Stop exploring once the target location, closest applicable implementation contract, any API contract required by the task, and a suitable verification path are known. Do not recursively read `src`, `registry`, or `src/extensions` merely to gain general confidence. Repository-wide inspection is reserved for an explicit audit, upgrade, migration, or cross-cutting refactor.

When a requested server-backed capability has no reliable existing example, reading Swagger is required before claiming it can be implemented. Locate and fetch the relevant collection or plugin namespace, then confirm the endpoint, method, parameters, request body, response, and documented permission expectations. If the required capability is absent from the available documents, do not guess an API or present the feature as supported; report the missing contract and determine whether a backend or plugin change is required.

When the active milestone edits application structure or UI foundations, read [Project Conventions](references/project-conventions.md). When it implements data, authentication, i18n, runtime configuration, or assets, read [NocoBase Runtime](references/nocobase-runtime.md).

## 2. Design the system before coding

At the start of system design, explicitly ask whether the user wants internationalization. If yes, confirm the primary locale and required additional locales; if the request already specifies them, do not ask again.

Create a compact internal product brief from the user's request:

- system purpose and working title;
- primary user roles and their frequent tasks;
- information architecture and menu hierarchy;
- page inventory and the responsibility of each page;
- core page content, actions, and states;
- route, dialog, drawer, and subpage model;
- frontend access-control model;
- visual direction, density, theme, and responsive behavior.

Keep implementation planning rolling and milestone-sized. For a complete system, outline later milestones briefly and plan the current reversible milestone in detail. Implement and verify it before refining the next milestone, and load specialized skills when their work becomes relevant.

Make reasonable product decisions when details are missing. Ask only when a missing choice materially changes business behavior, data, security, or an irreversible action.

Do not derive the whole product from a Users or CRUD example. Adapt page composition to the business: a workspace should surface work, an overview should surface actionable signals, a detail page should organize related context, and a form should follow the real workflow.

Treat the starter sidebar as a preset reference rather than a fixed application shell. As a product-design optimization, consider the navigation structure that best fits the system—such as top navigation, sidebar navigation, secondary menus, contextual tabs, or a restrained combination. This is guidance, not a requirement to replace the sidebar. Whichever pattern is chosen, keep navigation understandable and ensure its routes, direct access, responsive layout, and interaction remain usable across supported device sizes.

## 3. Design and configure roles and permissions

For a complete system, include a dedicated role-and-permission task in the Todo list or implementation plan. Do not bury it under project inspection, routing, or page implementation.

- Define the actual user roles, memberships, and role-specific responsibilities. If the system genuinely has one undifferentiated role, record that decision explicitly instead of silently omitting permission design.
- Decide and configure which roles may enter the Portal.
- When creating a role for the resolved Portal, pass that Portal's uid or exact identity to `nocobase-acl-manage` and treat its explicit Portal entry grant as part of role creation. Verify the role-to-Portal association before continuing.
- Configure and verify server resource/action/scope/field policies for each role before relying on frontend visibility.
- Design frontend menu, route, page, region, field, action, and record behavior for allowed and denied users.
- Use the installed ACL boundaries at the smallest correct scope: `AclPage` for a whole page, `AclRegion` for an independent protected panel, `AclField` for a field or field group, and `CanAccess` or ACL-aware built-in action components for controls and record operations. Do not duplicate their checks with local booleans or hard-coded role comparisons.
- Hiding a control is not sufficient security; NocoBase server ACL remains authoritative.

Use `nocobase-acl-manage` for role, membership, Portal entry, and server ACL changes. Read [Routing and Access](references/routing-and-access.md) completely before implementing frontend permissions, and verify at least one allowed and one denied role or permission state.

## 4. Establish navigation and URLs

Design navigation and URL surfaces before implementing page internals:

- Every visible leaf menu must lead to a real, accessible route.
- Every page intended to appear in the sidebar must declare both its route and a Refine `resource`; a route element alone does not create a menu item.
- Do not create placeholder menu items or empty groups.
- Dialogs, drawers, details, editors, and meaningful subpages must have independent URLs that support direct open, refresh, sharing, and browser history.
- Decide whether every create, edit, and show action is a drawer, dialog, or full page before implementing its route. Treat `resourceAction` as Refine path metadata, not as a presentation choice.
- Register only one canonical `resourceAction` path for each resource create, edit, or show action. When the same surface opens from another list, detail, or workflow host, reuse its business content through an ordinary relative child route owned by that host; do not navigate to the canonical absolute URL and replace the current workflow.
- Preserve the complete originating URL, including search and hash, when opening a contextual child surface. Closing must restore that URL when known and use the resolved parent route as the direct-entry fallback.

Read [Routing and Access](references/routing-and-access.md) completely whenever the task adds or changes navigation, routes, dialogs, drawers, subpages, roles, or permissions.

## 5. Implement application-owned code

- Put all application-owned business functionality—including routes, pages, components, hooks, utilities, and translations—in application-owned `src` directories, following the project's current organization. Never create `src/extensions/<business-feature>` for it.
- Reserve `src/extensions` for installed Registry extension source and treat `src/components/ui` as the shadcn foundation. Do not modify either by default.
- When reusing an extension or base component, import, re-export, wrap, or compose it from application-owned code. Modify its source only when the task explicitly requires changing that extension or foundation and composition cannot satisfy the requirement; keep the diff minimal.
- Use React, TypeScript, Refine, React Router, Tailwind, and shadcn Base UI patterns already present in the project.
- Never introduce Ant Design or Ant Design-based NocoBase client components.
- Respect Base UI rendering contracts. When a controlled `Select` stores an enum key or record ID, resolve and render its user-facing label in `SelectValue` instead of exposing the raw value.
- Reuse the Portal's API client, data provider, authentication session, ACL runtime, i18n runtime, system settings, basename, and asset URL helpers.
- Use the NocoBase `query` action for charts, KPIs, and grouped aggregation; do not fetch every list record and derive server-scale analytics in the browser.
- Cover loading, empty, error, unauthorized, success, destructive confirmation, and responsive states as appropriate.
- Use semantic tokens and shared composition. Avoid one-off colors, arbitrary dimensions, excessive `className`, and unnecessary rewrites of shadcn defaults.
- Preserve the template's root and page error boundaries. Use the installed `NocoBaseErrorBoundary` at `region` scope for independently recoverable renderers such as charts, AI output, or third-party widgets; do not recreate error-boundary infrastructure in business code.

When a real system is being built, remove template presentation from the application surface: hide or unregister demo navigation and routes at the application layer, replace starter branding and copy, and make the first accessible page useful for the target users. Do not delete installed extension source merely to hide a demo entry.

## 6. Populate representative demo data

For a new or substantially rebuilt system, populate coherent demo records after the data model and core workflows are working. This is part of the build deliverable, not an optional follow-up.

- Create records through real NocoBase APIs or CLI commands; do not hard-code mock business records in frontend components.
- Cover the primary collections, associations, option values, owners, statuses, and dates needed to make the landing page, lists, details, filters, dashboards, and AI context meaningful.
- Use recognizable demo identifiers and inspect existing records first so reruns do not create uncontrolled duplicates. Never overwrite or delete existing user data to make room for a demo.
- Exercise at least one realistic end-to-end workflow in the data, rather than filling every field with unrelated placeholders.
- If the target contains real business data, record creation is not authorized, or the API rejects the operation, do not silently omit this step. Report the reason and the exact remaining data setup.

## 7. Choose and apply a theme

If the user did not specify a theme, choose a restrained, coherent direction appropriate to the system and continue without blocking. Define theme behavior through application-level semantic tokens and shared layout rules.

If the user wants to choose a theme, direct them to `https://www.shadcn.io/theme` and accept the selected theme name, Registry URL, or generated installation command. Review the working tree and installer diff, integrate the theme with application branding, and avoid blindly overwriting customized `src/components/ui` files. A theme supplies visual foundations; it does not replace business-specific information architecture, content, states, or interactions.

## 8. Implement meaningful AI interaction

After the system's core workflows work without AI, review the finished pages and identify interactions where AI can materially reduce effort or improve decisions. Good candidates include natural-language retrieval, summarization, extraction, classification, drafting, explanation, guided analysis, and multi-step assistance grounded in current page or record context.

For a complete AI Portal system build, implement at least one credible, contextual AI interaction. Evaluation or a list of possible ideas alone does not complete this requirement. Choose the best-supported interaction without asking for another confirmation when it does not materially change business behavior or security.

- Use targeted search to locate the installed AI example closest to the chosen interaction. Inspect that example, its public contract, and only the direct dependencies needed to reuse it; do not enumerate all installed AI extensions, hooks, demos, or tool renderers.
- Never add, bind, expose, or select developer-category employees for Portal AI interactions. Exclude known developer usernames such as `nathan`, `dara`, `lina`, and `orin` even when they are returned by discovery APIs; use a suitable business employee or create a dedicated one.
- Before implementing a page-level AI interaction, locate the installed Page Context scenario closest to the requirement. Prefer an existing pattern—manual page-element selection, Shortcut task context, conversation preset context, inherited `AIPageContextScope`, Form filler, or a permission-aware custom frontend Tool—and reuse its context and task contracts.
- Prefer contextual entry points close to the relevant page, record, selection, or action. Make the context being shared and the result being produced clear to the user.
- Preserve a complete non-AI workflow. AI output must not silently bypass validation, ACL, confirmation, or server-side business rules.
- Reuse existing AI runtime and employee/tool contracts. Use `nocobase-ai-employee` when employee, model, tool, or prompt configuration is required.
- Do not satisfy the requirement with a decorative chat button or an unsupported capability. If no employee, model, tool contract, or runtime can support a credible interaction, diagnose the missing prerequisite and report the AI portion as incomplete instead of silently skipping it.

## 9. Verify the result with tests

Design verification alongside implementation. Add or update the smallest valuable set of automated tests that protects the changed behavior and the system's primary workflows; do not create tests merely to increase coverage or test count.

Use frontend tests for pure logic and local component interaction that can run without backend data, authentication, ACL, or data-provider mocks. Use E2E tests against a real NocoBase environment for authentication, data, roles and permissions, routing integration, files, AI, and complete user journeys. Cover the primary successful workflow and representative high-risk denied, error, or recovery paths.

Run type checking, relevant frontend tests, relevant E2E tests, and the production build. Use focused browser inspection only for exploratory visual or responsive checks that automated assertions cannot reasonably express; it must not replace repeatable acceptance tests.

Read [Verification](references/verification.md) before completing a substantial page or system build.

## 10. Upgrade an existing Portal safely

Treat a Portal upgrade as a source migration, not a package-only update. Keep the
application's own version independent from the exact inherited base release in
`nocobase.defaultTemplateVersion`.

Before changing an existing Portal's template, Portal SDK major, or installed
Registry source, read [Portal Project Upgrades](references/project-upgrades.md)
completely. Treat user code as irreplaceable: establish and verify a recovery
point first, including a separate backup when the project is not a Git
repository. Present the target versions, source impact, conflict strategy,
verification, and rollback plan, and obtain explicit user confirmation before
editing. Then merge the required base-template source without overwriting
application-owned code, update installed Registry items separately, and change
compatibility metadata only after the matching source has actually been
incorporated and verified.

# Coordination Boundaries

- Use `nocobase-data-modeling` when the requested UI requires creating or changing backend collections or fields, then return here for source implementation.
- Use `nocobase-acl-manage` when roles, user-role membership, Portal entry access, or server-side resource policy must change; keep frontend access-control implementation in this skill.
- Use `nocobase-ai-employee` for AI employee discovery, lifecycle, models, tools, or prompt configuration.
- Use `nocobase-portal-manage` for Portal create, source sync, dev lifecycle, push, deploy, or destroy operations.
- Diagnose and report a missing runtime capability rather than replacing NocoBase infrastructure with a parallel local implementation.
