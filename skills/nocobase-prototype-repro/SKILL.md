  NocoBase 2 only; never use in a NocoBase 3 project. Use when a task provides a prototype to reproduce — an HTML file, an
  image, or a link, INCLUDING the published form "Build a NocoBase app — X … Match the
  layout and signature visuals of this reference prototype: <url>" — or when someone
  says a built page "doesn't match the prototype / looks monotone / is ugly". A
  prototype/URL being present is what triggers this skill, EVEN WHEN the same prompt
  also says "build an app" — the verb "build" does not cancel the prototype. Skip it
  only when there is NO prototype at all: a bare "build me a CRM/app" → nocobase-app-
  discipline; a one-field edit / rename → nocobase-ui-builder. It turns "here is the
  prototype, build it" into a faithful app — analyze prototype, native CRUD, the right
  native block per region, then a screenshot-vs-prototype visual loop. Native-first; JS
  only inside a native container; never a full-page JS block. Mechanics live in
  nocobase-ui-builder, nocobase-data-modeling, nocobase-app-discipline.

# Goal

Turn a prototype + a one-line ask into a faithful NocoBase app. This is a **meta / orchestration skill** — it sequences `nocobase-data-modeling` + `nocobase-ui-builder` + `nocobase-app-discipline` and adds the two things that decide fidelity: a **region → native-block mapping** and a **visual convergence loop**. It does not re-teach the CLI; it routes to the sibling skills for mechanics and owns only the reproduction-specific judgment.

# When to use / Non-Goals

**Hard gate (check before selecting this skill):** there must be an actual prototype in hand — an HTML file, a screenshot, or a link to one — that you are matching against. No prototype, no fidelity gap → this is **not** the skill; a plain "build me an app / a page" request belongs to `nocobase-app-discipline` (whole system) or `nocobase-ui-builder` (single page/edit). Do not let this skill shadow the normal build flow.

**Use when:**
- The user gives a prototype (HTML file, link, screenshot, or a `public/prototypes/...` URL to curl) and wants it reproduced in NocoBase.
- A page already exists but the user says it's monotone / ugly / doesn't match the prototype / a region should be a list/card/kanban instead of a table — i.e. there is a **visual target and a fidelity gap**.

**Non-Goals — hand off, do not do here:**
- Pure data modeling (collections/fields/relations with no visual target) → `nocobase-data-modeling`.
- Workflows / automations → `nocobase-workflow-manage`. ACL / permissions → `nocobase-acl-manage`. Plugin work → `nocobase-plugin-development`.
- A localized UI edit with **no visual target and no fidelity gap** (move one field, rename an action, tweak a reaction) → `nocobase-ui-builder` **directly**. This skill is only worth its overhead when you are matching a prototype's look/behavior; for a mechanical surface edit, skip straight to ui-builder.
- Whole-page authoring from a business sentence with **no** prototype → author a quick prototype first ([prototype-authoring.md](references/prototype-authoring.md)), then this skill; or if the user just wants a generic page, that's `nocobase-ui-builder`'s `applyBlueprint`.

# Router — task shape → read first

Hit one route, read its "first" doc, and only open the "then" docs when that route is still not enough. Sibling skills own the mechanics; the reference files here own the reproduction-specific judgment.

# Why fidelity varies — the levers (internalize these)

Observed across many reproductions, in order of impact:

1. **The screenshot→compare→fix loop.** The single biggest factor. An agent that renders, **looks at its own screenshot next to the prototype**, lists the gaps, and iterates converges. One that builds and declares done plateaus at "no errors but ugly". Text-only verification proves "it renders"; only a visual pass proves "it matches". See [visual-loop.md](references/visual-loop.md).
2. **Gotchas pre-loaded.** The 10–20% that stalls weak runs is almost always the alpha-version JS sandbox + flow-surfaces JSON contract. Pre-supplying those skips ~10–20 failed attempts and stops the failure mode where the agent gives up and collapses the page into one big JS block. See [gotchas.md](references/gotchas.md).
3. **Targets bound tightly.** "Page uid X, block uid Y, do these N things, verify before done" beats "fix this page". Vague targets cause scope drift or stopping at CRUD.
4. **Right block per region.** Reaching for a table everywhere is the #1 cause of "monotone". The prototype usually wants a list of cards, a kanban, a calendar, a grid. See the Region table + [block-recipes.md](references/block-recipes.md).
5. **Model.** Stronger models recover from contract errors and can act as the visual reviewer; weaker models do well on tightly-scoped, gotcha-loaded mechanical work. Give the levers above and a mid model reproduces faithfully.

# Workflow — staged, with user-confirmation gates

Do it in order. **Stop at each ▣ CONFIRM gate and get the user's go-ahead before the next stage.** For anything beyond a small single-region tweak, plan it as a multi-round conversation rather than one silent mega-run — the user wants to steer at each big step.

**Phase 0 — Load the target.** If you already have the prototype, skip to loading it; only author one if the user gave a business sentence with no prototype ([prototype-authoring.md](references/prototype-authoring.md)). Curl/read the prototype (the **visual target**; without it, builds degrade to a generic table or one big JS block). **Check for an embedded `<script type="application/nb-spec+json">`** — if present, parse it as the **authoritative spec** (data model, per-region block, interactions, JS kernels) and honor its `notes`/`jsKernels`, instead of inferring. Load [block-recipes.md](references/block-recipes.md) + [gotchas.md](references/gotchas.md). Identify env; pass `-e <env> -y` on every `nb api`; get live page/block uids (`flow-surfaces get` / `desktopRoutes`), never trust uids from docs.

**Phase 1 — Analyze & plan → SPEC  ▣ CONFIRM.** Produce a structured SPEC from [spec-template.md](references/spec-template.md) (LLM judgment vs the rendered prototype, not a parser): data model; page list incl. the **signature page(s)**; **region → block map** (prevents "everything is a table"); and the **interaction checklist** — go region by region and list every affordance (faceted/multi-select filters with counts, status pills, search, sort, fill-the-width grid, click→popup, inline edit, drag, live refresh); each maps to a recipe, anything non-native is flagged a JS kernel. Show the SPEC, get explicit confirmation.

**Phase 2 — Model + native CRUD + seed  ▣ CONFIRM.** Build collections/fields/relations in one pass (`nocobase-data-modeling`); never edit while building. Stand up plain-native backend (Table + Filter + Add new + View/Edit; View opens a **drawer** with Details + association sub-tables via `associationName` + `sourceId={{ctx.view.inputArgs.filterByTk}}`). Seed every enum branch, ≥2 children/parent, **all-English** for public demos, and **enough density** (fill 1–2 months for a calendar — sparse reads as broken). Confirm CRUD works.

**Phase 3 — Refine to the prototype, region by region.** Native-first. For each signature region, pick its block and build it; add JS **only** for the kernel a native block can't express; **never collapse the page into one JS block**. One region at a time so each is verifiable. Mechanics + runnable snippets in [block-recipes.md](references/block-recipes.md).

**Phase 4 — Visual convergence loop  ▣ CONFIRM + report.** Render → screenshot → **compare against the prototype with a vision-capable pass** → concrete gap list → fix → re-shoot, until it matches. Reviewer may be the same agent self-checking or a separate vision model — let the model choose by situation. Full procedure in [visual-loop.md](references/visual-loop.md). Deliver the report (uids touched, what changed, gaps/tradeoffs, screenshots) and confirm.

# Region → native block (the anti-monotone table)

**The native-first ladder — climb only as far as the prototype forces you. Pick the lowest rung that matches.**

1. **Native block + native fields.** Try this first for every region. If a native Table / List / GridCard / Details / Kanban / Calendar / Chart with plain **native fields** already looks **basically like the prototype** (right data, right shape, layout close enough) — **ship it and move on.** Do **not** bolt JS onto a region that's already close: native fields give you binding / sort / filter / format for free and have none of the JS data-binding bugs that sink fidelity. "Good enough native" beats "ambitious JS that renders empty".
2. **Native block + JS item** — the **encouraged default the moment native fields fall short.** When fields can't reproduce the look (a styled card, status pill, progress bar, KPI number, sparkline, ring/gauge, rich first column), **keep the native container** (it still owns resource binding / CRUD / filter / pagination / ACL) and render the custom look as a **JS item / JS field / JS column / JS action *inside* it**. Reach for this — not a freestanding block. **Don't hand-write the body from scratch** — [template-library/](references/template-library/_index.md) ships a working body for most of these (KPI card, donut, leaderboard, due-soon/low-stock alert, progress bar, trend, facets, card grid); fill its `$p`, paste into the model's `runJs.code`, adjust.
3. **Freestanding JS block** — last resort, **only** when the region has no data container at all (glowing map, kiosk scanner, standalone gauge). Never collapse a data-backed region — or the whole page — into one JS block.

The table maps each prototype region to its rung; the "JS kernel?" column is the *content* rendered inside the native container, never a replacement for it.

| Prototype region looks like… | Use | JS kernel? |
|---|---|---|
| **Form** — compose / create / edit, with custom controls or a live preview | **native Form block** with **JS items / JS actions nested inside** (pills, counter, live preview bound to form values). **Not** a freestanding JSBlock form. | yes — items/preview |
| Spreadsheet / dense rows of fields | **Table** | optional: one **JS column** (whole-record cell) for a rich first column |
| Feed / list of **cards**, contacts, activity, "currently X" | **List + JS item** (whole-record renderer per row); single-column card feed | yes — the card body |
| **Catalog with left facet rail + status pills + grid** | **Rich catalog archetype**: JS facet rail (multi-select + counts) + status pill bar + **List + JS card + CSS auto-fill grid**, cross-filtered. `block-recipes.md §3b` | yes — facets, pills, card |
| **Responsive card grid that fills the width** | **List + JS card + CSS auto-fill** (`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px,1fr))`). `block-recipes.md §3` | yes — the card body |
| Plain fixed-breakpoint card grid (no facets, no fill) | **GridCard + JS card** — `add-field --renderer js` on GridCardItemModel, remove sibling DetailsItemModel nodes, `showLabel:false`. `block-recipes.md §3` | yes — the card body |
| Photo / avatar **gallery**, people directory (native fields only) | **GridCard** (native fields, no JS) | optional |
| **Board** with status columns, pipeline | **Kanban**, `groupField=<status>`; card field limit 2 → add a **JS card field** | yes — the card |
| **Calendar** / schedule / room booking by day | **Calendar** (`startField/endField/titleField`) | rarely |
| **Charts**, KPIs, analytics dashboard | **Chart** (builder for single-table aggregates; custom raw ECharts for gauge/heatmap). Big-number KPI → small JS block | KPI only |
| **Tree** / org chart / nested categories | **Tree** block | no |
| **Filter bar** that drives another region | **FilterForm** + cross-block filter | sometimes |
| Quick-filter pills / custom control on a data block | **JS item in the block's top-right toolbar** (`add-action --use JSItemActionModel`) | yes — the toolbar widget |
| Detail **drawer/popup** on click | native popup via a real **ViewActionModel** (`ctx.openView(<viewActionUid>, {filterByTk})`) | n/a |
| Custom viz with NO data container: glowing map, kiosk, gauge, standalone feed | **JS block** (the *only* legitimate freestanding-JS case) | yes |

**The container/content split (the core rule).** For **any region backed by data** the **container is always a native block** (Form/Table/List/GridCard/Kanban/Calendar) — it gives resource binding, CRUD, filter, pagination, ACL for free. **JS only renders the content *inside*** that container: a JS item (form field / list card), JS column (table cell), JS field (whole-record card), JS action (button), or a JS item in the top-right toolbar (pills / custom controls). Reproduce the prototype's exact look *inside* the native container; never throw the container away. A **freestanding JS block** is reserved for a region with *no* data container (map, kiosk, gauge). **Any non-native or interactive element MUST be a JS item/block — never skipped, never faked with a static native field** (a live phone-preview in a composer is a JS item bound to `ctx.form.getFieldsValue()` + `formValuesChange`, not a static card).

# Hard rules

- **Container native, content JS.** Every data region's container is a native block; JS only renders *inside* it. Never replace a native data container with a freestanding JS block (reserved for data-less visuals). Never one page = one JS block.
- **Filter operators are metadata-driven.** Before copying, adapting, or authoring any native/JS filter condition, load the `nocobase-utils` skill with topic `filter`, then read [Filter Condition Format](../nocobase-utils/references/filter/index.md), resolve the terminal field's live frontend interface/type, and reselect the operator from that field group's allowlist. Changing a template's field invalidates any assumption that its original operator still applies. Date comparisons never use `$lt`, `$lte`, `$gt`, or `$gte`.
- Edit deployed JS via `curl flowModels:save` (flat full-field upsert, preserves `parentId`). **Never `flowModels:update`** (clears parentId, node vanishes).
- After any add/remove block, sync the grid's **v2 `props.layout` + legacy `props.rows` + `stepParams.gridSettings.grid`** consistently, or the client throws a false "Collection may have been deleted".
- JS sandbox: `ctx.libs.React/antd/antdIcons` in JSFieldModel (not `ctx.antdIcons`); no `window`/`document`/`localStorage`; no local var named `location`; font strings can't contain spaces (`SFMono-Regular`); read whole record via `ctx.getVar('ctx.record')`. Full list: [gotchas.md](references/gotchas.md).
- Every select→Tag/color mapping must fall back to the raw value for unknown enums (else "Tag not found" at render).
- **Done = verified**: Playwright in a fresh no-cache browser with injected `localStorage NOCOBASE_TOKEN`, open `/admin/<pageSchemaUid>`, confirm every block renders, no console/page errors, interactions work — *and* a visual pass vs the prototype.
