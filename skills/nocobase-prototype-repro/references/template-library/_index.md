# NocoBase JS widget library — agent reference

Synced from `@albert/plugin-flow-template-library` (57 templates). Each entry is one working JS block/item/column body + its `$p` input contract. To use: pick by purpose below, open `<key>.md`, fill `$p` for the target collection/fields, then write `const $p = {…}\n` + body into the model `stepParams.jsSettings.runJs.code` via `flowModels:save`.

> **Unique key** = filename = template `key` in the plugin; re-sync overwrites in place.

## Filter adaptation gate

Before using or adapting any template that constructs a NocoBase filter, load the `nocobase-utils` skill with topic `filter`, then read [Filter Condition Format](../../../nocobase-utils/references/filter/index.md) and inspect live metadata for every replacement field. A template operator is valid only for the original field's operator group; after changing `$p` field names, reselect each operator from the replacement terminal field's frontend allowlist. In particular, date comparisons use date-specific operators and never the number-only `$lt`, `$lte`, `$gt`, or `$gte`.
