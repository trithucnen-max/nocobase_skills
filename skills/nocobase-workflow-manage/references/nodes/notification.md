# Notification

## Node Type

`notification`

## Node Description
Sends a system notification; channels, recipients, and content can be configured via notification plugins.

## Business Scenario Example

* Sending an in-app notification to operational personnel when inventory is low.
* Sending email notification to user when some task is completed.

## Configuration List

| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| channelName | string | None | Yes | The notification channel to use, which corresponds to the `channelName` defined in the notification channels (API: `notificationChannels:list`). Use the `name` value from the list. |
| ignoreFail | boolean | false | No | Whether to ignore failure and continue the process if sending fails. |

Other fields depend on the specific notification channel type.

### Message Configuration of `in-app-message` type

| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| title | string | None | Yes | The title of the in-app message. Could use variables in title as string template. |
| content | string | None | Yes | The content of the in-app message. Could use variables in content as string template. |
| receivers | Array<string\|number\|object> | [] | Yes | The recipients of the in-app message, specified as an array of user IDs or user queries. User IDs could be found by query `users:list` API, or use variables of user IDs form upstream. The query object will contains a `filter` object to describe the query condition of users collection.  See [Common Conventions - filter](../conventions/index.md#the-filter-field-in-trigger-and-node-configuration). |
| options | object | {} | No | Additional options for the in-app message. |
| options.url | string | None | The URL that the user will be directed to when they click on the message. |
| options.mobileUrl | string | None | The URL that the user will be directed to when they click on the message on a mobile device. |
| options.duration | number | 5 | The duration (in seconds) that the message will be displayed on screen. |

If static recivers are intended, could call API `users:list` to get user IDs and fill in the array. If dynamic receivers are intended, could use variables or specify the query condition.

Before authoring a receiver query `filter`, load the `nocobase-utils` skill with topic `filter`, then read [Filter Condition Format](../../../nocobase-utils/references/filter/index.md), resolve the terminal field type, and use only its frontend operator allowlist. Always use an explicit operator object; do not place a scalar value directly under a field path.

### Message Configuration of `email` type

| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| subject | string | None | Yes | The subject of the email. |
| contentType | string | `"html"` | Yes | The content type of the email (e.g., "text" or "html"). |
| html | string | None | Yes | The HTML content of the email. Required if `contentType` is "html". |
| text | string | None | Yes | The text content of the email. Required if `contentType` is "text". |
| to | string[] | None | Yes | The recipient's email addresses. Could use variables. |
| cc | string[] | [] | No | The email addresses to be CC'd. Could use variables. |
| bcc | string[] | [] | No | The email addresses to be BCC'd. Could use variables. |

## Branch Description
Does not support branches.

## Test Support
Supported. This node can use CLI `workflow flow-nodes test` and HTTP `flow_nodes:test`, because the server-side instruction implements `test()`.
