# Workflow Output

## Node Type

`output`

## Node Description
Sets the output value of the current workflow; when this workflow is called by a sub-workflow, the output value can be used as an upper-level process variable. In the case of multiple outputs, the last executed output node prevails.

## Business Scenario Example
A sub-workflow calculates a result and returns it to the upper-level workflow as a subsequent variable.

## Configuration List
| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | any | None | No | Output value, supports constants or variable expressions, any JSON type. |

## Branch Description
Does not support branches.

## Test Support
Not supported. This node cannot use CLI `workflow flow-nodes test` or HTTP `flow_nodes:test`, because the server-side instruction does not implement `test()`.

## Example Configuration
```json
{
  "value": {
    "total": "{{ $context.data.total }}",
    "count": "{{ $context.data.count }}"
  }
}
```

## Output Variables
This node exposes a single root result value, referenced directly as `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.<nodeKey>}}`.

- Exposed root: the configured workflow output value of this node.
- No child field tree is provided. If the output is an object/array and a later node needs any child field, you must follow this node with `json-variable-mapping` or `json-query`, model the required fields, and make later nodes use only the JSON node's outputs.
- Do not manually append child paths to the output node root. Only the JSON modeling node should consume the raw root.
- Example reference: `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.workflow_output}}`.
