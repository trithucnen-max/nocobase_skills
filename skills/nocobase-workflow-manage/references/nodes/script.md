# JavaScript

## Node Type

`script`

## Node Description
Executes a piece of JavaScript code in an isolated Node.js sandbox environment (Worker Thread) and returns the result. Suitable for complex logic that cannot be handled by built-in expression engines.

## Business Scenario Example
Custom data transformation, complex conditional calculations, string processing, calling Node.js built-in modules, etc.

## Configuration List
| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| arguments | array | [] | No | List of input arguments, each item `{ name, value }`. `name` is the variable name available in the script, `value` is the variable value. Variable names must be valid JavaScript identifiers and cannot be duplicated. Variables should follow [Common Conventions - variables](../conventions/index.md#variable-expressions). |
| content | string | `return "Hello world!";` | Yes | The JavaScript code to execute. If `return someVariable` is used, the value of `someVariable` will be returned as the node's output. |
| timeout | number | 0 | No | Maximum execution time in milliseconds. `0` means no timeout. |
| continue | boolean | false | No | Whether to continue the workflow when the script throws an exception. If `true`, the node status is resolved even on error; if `false`, the node status is set to error. |

## Script Execution Environment
- The script runs in an isolated Node.js Worker Thread, not in the main process.
- Arguments defined in `arguments` are available as variables with the same names in the script.
- Use `return` to return results; the return value becomes the node's output.
- `console.log()` and `console.error()` output is captured in the workflow log.
- When the workflow is synchronous, the script executes synchronously within the request; when asynchronous, the script executes in the background and resumes the workflow upon completion.

## Modules and APIs Available in the Script
- Standard JavaScript built-in objects and functions (e.g., `Array`, `Date`, `Math`, etc.).
- Modules can not be imported by default. If you need specific Node.js modules, please add `WORKFLOW_SCRIPT_MODULES` environment variable in the format of comma-separated module names (e.g., `fs,path,lodash`), and these modules will be available for import in the script. When using modules, the execution engine will use `node:vm` (instead of `isolated-vm`), and the sandbox will have access to the Node.js environment, so be cautious of security implications.

## Branch Description
Does not support branches.

## Test Support
Supported. This node can use CLI `workflow flow-nodes test` and HTTP `flow_nodes:test`, because the server-side instruction implements `test()`.

## Example Configuration
```json
{
  "arguments": [
    { "name": "price", "value": "{{$context.data.price}}" },
    { "name": "quantity", "value": "{{$context.data.quantity}}" }
  ],
  "content": "return price * quantity * 0.9;",
  "timeout": 5000,
  "continue": false
}
```

## Output Variables
This node exposes a single root result value, referenced directly as `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.<nodeKey>}}`.

- Exposed root: the value returned by `return` in the script.
- No child field tree is provided.
- If the script returns an object or array and any downstream node needs a child field, you must follow this node with `json-variable-mapping` or `json-query`, model the required fields, and make later nodes use only the JSON node's outputs.
- Do not manually append child paths to the script node root. Only the JSON modeling node should consume the raw object/array.
- Example reference: `{{$jobsMapByNodeKey.script_total}}`.
