# Multi-condition Branch

## Node Type

`multi-conditions`

## Node Description
Evaluates multiple conditions in sequential order; if a condition is met, the process enters the corresponding branch, otherwise it continues to evaluate the next condition. If none are met, it enters the "otherwise" branch.

## Business Scenario Example
Choosing different processing branches based on status/level, similar to switch/case or if-else if.

## Configuration List
| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| conditions | array | None | Yes | List of conditional branches, corresponding to the branch order in the array. For the structure of each item, see "Structure of conditions item" below. |
| continueOnNoMatch | boolean | false | No | Whether to continue subsequent nodes after the "otherwise" branch is executed when no conditions are met. `false` means it ends with a failure. |

### Structure of conditions item
| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| uid | string | None | No | Unique identifier for the conditional branch, mainly used for front-end display; recommended to provide. If no value already exists, follow [nocobase-utils UID generation](../../../nocobase-utils/references/uid/index.md) to resolve the shared helper path first, then run `node <resolved-path-to-uid.js>` and write the generated value into the config. |
| title | string | None | No | Title of the conditional branch; defaults to "Condition X" if not set. |
| engine | string | basic | Yes | Calculation engine: `basic`, `math.js`, `formula.js`. See [evaluator engine reference](../../../nocobase-utils/references/evaluators/index.md) for engine selection guidance. |
| calculation | object | None | Yes (engine=basic) | Used when `engine=basic`, structure same as `calculation` in the Condition node. |
| expression | string | None | Yes (engine!=basic) | Expression used when `engine` is not `basic`. For available functions see [formula.js reference](../../../nocobase-utils/references/evaluators/formulajs.md) or [math.js reference](../../../nocobase-utils/references/evaluators/mathjs.md). |

## Branch Description

- Branch indexes:
  - `branchIndex = 0` reserved for the "otherwise" branch.
  - Positive integers (`1..n`) correspond to each condition block in left-to-right order.
- Each branchIndex value can appear at most once.
- When adding a new condition branch, pick the next integer after the current maximum.

## Test Support
Not supported. This node cannot use CLI `workflow flow-nodes test` or HTTP `flow_nodes:test`, because the server-side instruction does not implement `test()`.

## UID-backed Configuration Rule

- Keep an existing `conditions[].uid` value if the source payload already has one.
- Otherwise generate it first by following [nocobase-utils UID generation](../../../nocobase-utils/references/uid/index.md). Do not leave placeholder values such as `c1` or `condition-1` in the final payload when a real config UID is needed.

## Example Configuration
```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "uid": "<pre-generated uid if missing>",
      "title": "Approved",
      "engine": "basic",
      "calculation": {
        "group": {
          "type": "and",
          "calculations": [
            {
              "calculator": "equal",
              "operands": ["{{ $context.data.status }}", "approved"]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "uid": "<pre-generated uid if missing>",
      "title": "Total > 1000",
      "engine": "math.js",
      "expression": "{{ $context.data.total }} > 1000"
    }
  ],
  "continueOnNoMatch": true
}
```
