description: "Use in synchronous Webhook workflows to return a custom HTTP response and end the request-handling flow."

# Response

## Node Type

`response`

## Node Description
Configures the HTTP response content for a synchronous Webhook flow and terminates the flow.

## Business Scenario Examples
Directly returning validation results or processing status within a Webhook flow, analogous to a `return` in an HTTP handler.

## Configuration Items
| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| statusCode | number | 200 | Yes | HTTP status code. |
| headers | array | [] | No | Array of response headers, each item being `{ name, value }`. |
| body | object | {} | No | Response body (JSON only). |

## Branching
Does not support branches (terminal node).

## Test Support
Not supported. This node cannot use CLI `workflow flow-nodes test` or HTTP `flow_nodes:test`, because the server-side instruction does not implement `test()`.

## Example Configuration
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "headers": [
    { "name": "X-Request-Id", "value": "{{ $context.data.requestId }}" }
  ],
  "body": {
    "ok": true,
    "data": "{{ $context.data }}"
  }
}
```

## Output Variables
This node does not output variables.
