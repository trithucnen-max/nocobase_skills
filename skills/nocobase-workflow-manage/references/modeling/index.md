# Workflow Architecture and Core Concepts

## Architecture Overview

The NocoBase workflow engine is driven by four core tables: `workflows` (workflow definitions), `flow_nodes` (node chains), `executions` (execution records), and `jobs` (node job results).

During the orchestration phase, you mainly interact with `workflows` and `flow_nodes`. `executions` and `jobs` are records automatically generated at runtime and **do not require manual creation**.

```

## Core Data Models

| Table | Description | Detailed Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| `workflows` | Main workflow table; `type` is the trigger type, `config` is the trigger configuration, `key` is used for version grouping, and `current` identifies the active version. | [workflows.md](workflows.md) |
| `flow_nodes` | Node table; `upstreamId`/`downstreamId` form the chain structure, `branchIndex` represents the branch sequence, and `key` is used for cross-version referencing. | [flow_nodes.md](flow_nodes.md) |
| `executions` | Execution records; `context` is the trigger context, `status` is the execution status, and `output` stores the results of output nodes. | [executions.md](executions.md) |
| `jobs` | Node execution records; `nodeId`/`nodeKey` correspond to nodes, `status` is the node execution status, and `result`/`meta` store node outputs and metadata. | [jobs.md](jobs.md) |

## Version Control

- All versions of the same workflow share the same `key`.
- Only one version under each `key` can have `current: true`, which is the currently active version.
- **Versions that have already been executed (`versionStats.executed > 0`) cannot have their trigger configurations or nodes modified.** A new version (revision) must be created.
- Enabling a workflow (`enabled: true`) automatically sets it to `current: true` and sets the `current` status of old versions to `false`.
- The `sync` field cannot be modified after creation and must be determined during `workflows:create`.
- If need to create a new version, check [workflows:revision](../http-api/workflows.md#workflows:revision) API for details.

## Variable Reference Syntax

Variable expressions (`{{<path>}}`) are used throughout node configurations to reference dynamic data. Five variable groups are available: `$context` (trigger data), `$jobsMapByNodeKey` (upstream node results, indexed by node `key`), `$scopes` (loop/branch scope), `$system` (system values), and `$env` (environment variables).

For complete syntax rules, all variable groups, and usage examples, see [Common Conventions - Variable Expressions](../conventions/index.md#variable-expressions).

When a trigger or node returns JSON whose child fields are absent from the frontend variable tree, do not manually append server-resolvable paths. First add `json-variable-mapping` or `json-query`, define the required child fields, and use the modeled node output downstream. See [Common Conventions - Modeling Raw JSON](../conventions/index.md#modeling-raw-json-before-downstream-use).

**Key rule**: Node results must be referenced by the node's `key` property (a short random string like `6qww6wh1wb8`), **not** by the numeric `id`. Always read the actual `key` from the node record after creating it.

If a variable points to a data table structure, the internal property paths match the table field names.

## Execution Mode

The workflow execution mode is defined by the `sync` field on the `workflows` record. For the canonical description of sync vs async behavior, modeling guidance, and trigger capability constraints, see [workflows.md - Execution Mode](workflows.md#execution-mode).

## Status Codes

### Execution (execution) Status

| Value | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `null` | QUEUEING | Waiting for processing. |
| `0` | STARTED | Executing. |
| `1` | RESOLVED | Successfully completed. |
| `-1` | FAILED | Failed (expected failure, e.g., set by an end node). |
| `-2` | ERROR | Exceptional error. |
| `-3` | ABORTED | Aborted (usually initiated from the operations side). |
| `-4` | CANCELED | Canceled (usually initiated from the business side). |
| `-5` | REJECTED | Rejected (e.g., approval rejected). |
| `-6` | RETRY_NEEDED | Retry needed. |

### Node Job (job) Status

| Value | Status |
|---|---|
| `0` | PENDING (Waiting, e.g., for manual nodes) |
| `1` | RESOLVED |
| `-1` | FAILED |
| `-2` | ERROR |
| `-3` | ABORTED |
| `-4` | CANCELED |
| `-5` | REJECTED |
| `-6` | RETRY_NEEDED |
