# Pre-action Event

## Trigger Type

`request-interception`

## Use Cases
- Performing validation or logic judgment before data create, update, or delete operations are executed.
- Rejecting certain operation requests based on business rules (e.g., blocking submission when data validation fails).
- Preprocessing or reviewing submitted data before the operation is executed.

## Trigger Timing / Events
- Triggered **before** an operation request (initiated via a button or API) is actually executed.
- Acts as middleware intercepting `create`, `update`, `updateOrCreate`, and `destroy` operations.
- **Always executes synchronously** (`sync = true`); the request is only allowed to proceed after the flow completes.

## Configuration Items
| Field | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| collection | string | - | Yes | The data table to monitor, format is `"<dataSource>:<collection>"` (e.g., `"posts"` / `"mysql:orders"`; `dataSource` can be omitted when using the main data source). |
| global | boolean | false | No | Trigger mode: `false` Local mode (requires button binding), `true` Global mode (automatically effective for selected actions). |
| actions | string[] | - | Required only in Global mode | Action types to monitor in Global mode, supported: `"create"`, `"update"`, `"destroy"`. Commonly, only one action is used in one workflow, and this could make the logic clear. |

## Trigger Mode Details

### Local Mode (global = false)
- Requires manually binding this workflow to an action button.
- The workflow is only executed when the bound button triggers an action.
- Suitable for specific form or button scenarios.

### Global Mode (global = true)
- Takes effect globally for the selected action types on the specified data table, without manual binding.
- All matching operation requests automatically trigger this workflow.
- The `actions` field must be used to specify which actions to monitor.

## Execution Order
- Multiple workflows on the same data table execute sequentially: local mode workflows execute first, followed by global mode workflows.
- Local mode workflows execute in the order specified in the `triggerWorkflows` parameter.
- Global mode workflows execute in ascending order of workflow ID.
- Once any workflow intercepts the request, subsequent workflows are not executed.

## UI Setup for Local Mode

When `global = false`, this trigger only runs on buttons that are explicitly bound to the workflow.

- Supported UI entry points:
  - Create-form `Submit` / `Save` buttons.
  - Edit-form `Submit` / `Save` buttons.
  - Record-level `Update data` actions that submit an edit form.
  - `Delete` buttons.
- Not supported:
  - `Trigger workflow` buttons. Those are reserved for the `custom-action` trigger.
- If the page or button still needs to be added, use:
  - [UI builder recipe - forms and actions](../../../nocobase-ui-builder/references/recipes/forms-and-actions.md)
  - [UI builder settings - add-action](../../../nocobase-ui-builder/references/settings.md#add-action)
  - [UI builder settings - add-record-action](../../../nocobase-ui-builder/references/settings.md#add-record-action)

### Binding Steps

1. Create the workflow as `request-interception`, configure `collection`, and keep `global = false`.
2. Enable the workflow; disabled workflows are not selectable from the binding dialog.
3. Open the target page/block and locate the button whose request should be intercepted.
4. Open the button settings and choose `Bind workflows`.
5. Add a binding row.
6. Select the enabled pre-action workflow whose `config.collection` matches the selected context collection.
7. Save the binding and page/schema changes, then test both pass-through and intercepted cases from the UI.

### Global Mode Note

When `global = true`, no UI binding is needed. Any matching request on the configured collection and selected `actions` set is intercepted automatically.

## Interception Mechanism
- Flow completes normally (status: resolved, and without any end nodes executed): The request is allowed through, and the original operation continues.
- Flow is terminated by an "End Process" node with failure status: The request is intercepted, returning a 400 error with relevant error messages. This is most commonly used to block requests that fail validation or do not meet certain business requirements.
- Flow is terminated by an "End Process" node with success status: The request is intercepted, returning a 200 with relevant success messages. This can be used to block default operations while still returning a successful response, for example, to implement custom logic that prevents certain updates without treating them as errors.
- Flow execution error: Returns a 500 error.

## Example Configuration

### Local Mode
```json
{
  "collection": "mysql:orders",
  "global": false
}
```

### Global Mode
```json
{
  "collection": "orders",
  "global": true,
  "actions": ["create", "update"]
}
```

## Output Variables
The variable selector for this trigger is a tree array of `{ label, value, children? }`. At runtime, join the `value` segments with `.` and prepend `$context`.

- Exposed roots: `user`, `roleName`, `params`.
- `user` follows the `users` collection schema; `roleName` is a scalar string.
- `params.filterByTk` is exposed as the target record primary key.
- For create and update interception, `params.values` expands to the target collection's fields, so expressions such as `{{$context.params.values.status}}` are valid.
- The runtime context may also contain other request properties such as `params.filter`, but the variable selector described here exposes only `filterByTk` and `values`.
- Example references: `{{$context.user.nickname}}`, `{{$context.roleName}}`, `{{$context.params.filterByTk}}`, `{{$context.params.values.amount}}`.
