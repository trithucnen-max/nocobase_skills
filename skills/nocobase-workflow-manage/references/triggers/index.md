# Workflow Triggers

## Basic Data

Configuration items and output variables vary depending on the trigger type. The trigger type is represented by the `type` field value. Configuration items are stored in the `config` field (JSON).

The `type` field is determined when the workflow is created and cannot be changed thereafter. To modify the trigger configuration, the corresponding interface must be called to update the `config` field.

## Variables Produced by Triggers

Some triggers produce variables for use by subsequent nodes. In the UI, these variables are exposed as a tree array of `{ label, value, children? }`. `label` is only for display; the actual runtime expression is built from the `value` path.

For trigger variables, join the `value` path segments with `.` and prepend `$context`, for example `{{$context.data.title}}` or `{{$context.date}}`.

Each trigger document with an `Output Variables` section describes the exact tree roots it provides and shows example expressions.

Subsequent nodes can reference these variables in their configuration items based on business needs to achieve dynamic workflow logic.

If a trigger exposes a JSON object/array only as a root value, do not manually append child paths even if the server can resolve them. Add `json-variable-mapping` or `json-query` as the first node, explicitly model the required fields, and make all later nodes use that modeled output. See [Common Conventions - Modeling Raw JSON](../conventions/index.md#modeling-raw-json-before-downstream-use).

## Usage Notes

* **Only type values explicitly listed in the documentation can be used**; other values will cause the workflow to be unrecognized.
* Before authoring a persisted trigger `condition` or `filter`, load the `nocobase-utils` skill with topic `filter`, then read [Filter Condition Format](../../../nocobase-utils/references/filter/index.md), resolve each terminal field's live frontend interface/type, and use only that group's operator allowlist. Date fields must use date-specific comparison operators, never `$lt`, `$lte`, `$gt`, or `$gte`.
* Variables are NOT supported in trigger configuration items. Only static values are allowed.
* `approval` and `webhook` are commercial capabilities. Their matching plugins must be installed and activated before these trigger types are used. Apply the [Commercial Workflow Plugin Gate](../commercial-plugin-gate.md); if a required plugin is inactive, do not use the trigger type.
* An explicit approval request must remain an approval workflow. Never replace it with a `manual` node when the Approval plugin is inactive.

## Execution Mode Matrix

Execution mode semantics are defined by the workflow's `sync` field. See [workflows.md - Execution Mode](../modeling/workflows.md#execution-mode). The table below only summarizes trigger-specific support and constraints.

| Type Value | Mode Support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collection` | Depends on workflow `sync` | No trigger-specific mode rule documented here. |
| `schedule` | Async only | Always runs with `sync=false`. |
| `action` | Depends on workflow `sync` | No trigger-specific mode rule documented here. |
| `custom-action` | Sync or async | Behavior differs by mode; sync can intercept the request, async cannot. |
| `request-interception` | Sync only | Always runs with `sync=true`. |
| `webhook` | Sync or async | Response behavior differs by mode. |
| `approval` | Depends on workflow `sync` | No trigger-specific mode rule documented here. |
